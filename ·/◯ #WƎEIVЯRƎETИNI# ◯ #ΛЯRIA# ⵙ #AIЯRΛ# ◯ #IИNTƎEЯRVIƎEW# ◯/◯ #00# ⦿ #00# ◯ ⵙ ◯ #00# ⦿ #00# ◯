AS FAR AS THE EDITOR OF THE BOOK, "ALIEN INTERVIEW" IS CONCERNED, AND FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK IS A WORK OF FICTION. THE EDITOR MAKES NO CLAIM TO THE FACTUALITY OF THE CONTENT, AND IN FACT, CANNOT PROVE THAT THE ALLEGED AUTHOR ACTUALLY EVER EXISTED.

 

ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE DATES, LOCATIONS, PERSONS AND INCIDENTS DESCRIBED MAY BE FACTUAL OR BASED ON FACT, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO AUTHENTICATE THAT EQUALLY AS MANY MAY BE SUBJECTIVE CONTRIVANCES OF THE AUTHOR.

SOME MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE BOOK MAY HAVE SIMILARITIES TO EARTH PHILOSOPHIES AS THE VARIETY OF THESE ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO LIST, AND BEAR TOO MANY FUNDAMENTAL SIMILARITIES TO BE EASILY DIFFERENTIATED. ALTHOUGH THE BOOK DISCUSSES THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE, THE TIME TRACK OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES OF IMMORTAL AND/OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS, "ALIENS" OR "GODS", IT IS IN NO WAY THE INTENTION OF THE EDITOR TO REPRESENT, ENDORSE, FORWARD OR ASSUME THE VIEWPOINT OF THE AUTHOR, ANY POLITICAL DOCTRINE, ECONOMIC VESTED INTEREST, SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS, RELIGIOUS PRACTICE OR PHILOSOPHY, WHETHER TERRESTRIAL OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL.

DEDICATION

THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO ALL IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS, WHETHER THEY ARE AWARE OF THEMSELVES AS SUCH, OR NOT. IT IS ESPECIALLY DEDICATED TO THE WISDOM, COURAGE AND INTEGRITY OF THOSE GREATER BEINGS, WHO IN VARIOUS INCARNATIONS AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE PAST, IN THE PRESENT AND INTO THE FUTURE, ENKINDLE AND CARRY THE FLAME OF TRUTH INTO THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE UNIVERSE.


THIS DEDICATION IS NOT ONLY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL TEACHINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THESE BEINGS, BUT TO THE DEMONSTRATED AND DOCUMENTED COURAGE TO APPLY THEIR PHILOSOPHY IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING IGNORANCE, OVERT HOSTILITY AND AGGRESSIVE SUPPRESSION BY LESSER BEINGS AND BY THE SELF-SERVING VESTED INTERESTS OF INTER-GALACTIC AND PLANETARY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.


THOUGH RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER, THE PROFOUND WISDOM AND HEROIC DEDICATION OF SUCH BEINGS, AND THOSE WHO SHARE THEIR QUEST, HAVE BEEN THE ONLY EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO SPIRITUAL SLAVERY. FREEDOM, COMMUNICATION, CREATIVITY ,TRUST AND TRUTH FOR ALL IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS IN THIS UNIVERSE IS THEIR LEGACY. THE GOOD EXAMPLES SET BY THEM IS OUR SANCTUARY AND SUSTENANCE.

 

PERSONAL, DILIGENT APPLICATION OF THEIR TEACHINGS IS OUR WEAPON AGAINST THE DWINDLING SPIRAL OF CHAOS AND OBLIVION THAT IS THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE.

EDITORIAL GUIDELINES USED IN THIS BOOK

I HAVE TRIED NOT TO EDIT THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY EXCEPT TO THE DEGREE NECESSARY TO MAKE A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF THE MATERIAL SHE MAILED TO ME. WHEREVER POSSIBLE I HAVE QUOTED OR TRANSCRIBED HER ORIGINAL WRITTEN NOTES VERBATIM.


IN SOME INSTANCES I HAVE TAKEN EDITORIAL LIBERTY TO ADD OTHER INFORMATION, OR SUPPLEMENTARY COMMENTARY WHICH I FEEL WILL ADD USEFUL DEFINITIONS, OR CLARIFICATION TO THE INFORMATION GIVEN IN THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS, OR TO HER REMARKS OR OBSERVATIONS. THESE APPEAR AS A NUMBERED "(FOOTNOTE)" IN THE APPENDIX AT THE END OF THE BOOK. ALL FOOTNOTE REFERENCES, WHERE POSSIBLE, ARE COPIED VERBATIM FROM THE FREE INTERNET ENCYCLOPEDIA WEBSITE WWW.WIKIPEDIA.ORG.

 

IF INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH WIKIPEDIA.ORG, I USED THE POPULAR INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE WWW.GOOGLE.COM TO FIND A WEBSITE REFERENCE THAT SEEMED MOST APPROPRIATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER.


MRS. MACELROY DID NOT MAKE A NOTATION OF DATES IN THE MOST OF THE DOCUMENTS, SO I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT THE SEQUENCE OF MATERIAL MATCHES THE ACTUAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, OR SEQUENCE OF THE INTERVIEWS, EXCEPT AS NOTED ON THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS THEMSELVES.


SINCE IT HAS BEEN 60 YEARS SINCE THE DATE OF THE INTERVIEWS, AND CONSIDERING THE AGE OF MRS. MACELROY BEFORE HER DEATH, I REASONED THAT SHE DID NOT NECESSARILY HAVE AN ACUTE RECOLLECTION OF EXACT NAMES, DATES AND TIMES, EXCEPT AS RECORDED IN THE TRANSCRIPTS OF JULY 8TH THROUGH AUGUST 12TH, 1947.


THE MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE DIFFERENT TYPES. THE FOLLOWING NOTATIONS WILL BE USED TO DESIGNATE WHERE THESE APPEAR IN THIS BOOK:

INTRODUCTION - THE MYSTERY OF UFOS AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS

IF YOU HAVE STUDIED UFO PHENOMENA AT ALL, YOU ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE INFAMOUS ORSON WELLES RADIO BROADCAST OF "WAR OF THE WORLDS, AND THE INVASION FROM MARS" 1 (FOOTNOTE) ON OCT. 30, 1938. THIS FICTITIOUS RADIO DRAMATIZATION OF AN INVASION OF EARTH BY "ALIENS" INCITED A GLOBAL UFO AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL HYSTERIA LONG BEFORE THE UFO CRASH NEAR ROSWELL, N.M. IN 1947.


DURING THE PAST 60 YEARS, SINCE THE ALLEGED ROSWELL CRASH, THERE HAVE BEEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REPORTED UFO SIGHTINGS. A GLOBAL HYSTERIA HAS EMERGED FROM "EVIDENCE" OF WHAT IS PRESUMED TO BE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENON. CONCURRENTLY, THE UNRELENTING DENIAL OF THIS PHENOMENON BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS PRECIPITATED AN UNINTERRUPTED FLURRY OF ACCUSATIONS, COUNTER-ACCUSATIONS, COVER-UP CONSPIRACY THEORIES, LUNATIC FRINGE SPECULATIONS, "SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS", ETC., ETC., AD NAUSEAM, AND A GROWING MULTITUDE OF SIMILAR ALLEGED "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS".


MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I RECEIVED THE PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS FROM MRS. MACELROY WAS:

"THIS IS JUST ANOTHER SET OF MAJESTIC-12 DOCUMENTS". 2 (FOOTNOTE)

I AM REFERRING TO A "MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE" REPORTEDLY RECEIVED BY MAIL IN 1984 SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE LAST SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE SO-CALLED "MAJESTIC-12" COMMITTEE, ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED BY PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN SHORTLY AFTER THE ROSWELL INCIDENT IN 1947.


THERE ARE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES TO THE "MAJESTIC-12" DOCUMENTS AND THE PACKAGE I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY. IN THE CASE OF THE FORMER, AN ENVELOPE WAS SENT FROM AN ANONYMOUS SENDER WITH NO RETURN ADDRESS. IT CONTAINED AN UNDEVELOPED ROLL OF FILM. THAT'S ALL.

 

ON THE ROLL OF FILM WERE PHOTOS OF DOCUMENTS THAT WERE ASSUMED TO BE AUTHENTIC BY THE RECIPIENT AND HIS COLLEAGUES WHOSE VESTED INTEREST, I.E. LIVELIHOOD, DEPEND HEAVILY ON ATTRACTING PUBLIC NOTICE AND CREDIBILITY TO THEMSELVES AS "LEADING AUTHORITIES" ON THE SUBJECT OF UFO PHENOMENA. THEY HAVE WORKED RELENTLESSLY SINCE THEN TO DISCOVER "PROOF" THAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE AUTHENTIC. OF COURSE, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DENY EVERYTHING ALLEGED IN THE DOCUMENTS AND ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN GENERAL.


IN ADDITION, THE SUBJECT HAS BECOME SO THOROUGHLY OVERWHELMED WITH OBVIOUS FALSE REPORTS, DISCREDITED SOURCES, HEARSAY, MANUFACTURED FALSEHOODS, MISUNDERSTANDINGS, MISSING INFORMATION, ADDED INAPPLICABLE INFORMATION AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER CONFLICTING COMPLEXITIES WHICH HAVE MADE THE SUBJECT LAUGHABLE OR UNAPPROACHABLE AS A SCIENCE. THIS MAY BE INTENTIONAL, OR SIMPLY A REFLECTION OF THE GENERAL CHAOS AND BARBARISM THAT IS HUMANITY.


AS FOR GOVERNMENT DENIALS AND COVER-UPS, THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, HAVE MADE IT ABUNDANTLY APPARENT TO ME THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS DESTROYED ANY VESTIGE OF TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD MAY HAVE HARBORED, EVEN THROUGH THE VIETNAM WAR, WATERGATE, AND MANY SIMILAR BETRAYALS, IN THE "HONESTY" OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, BY BLATANTLY LYING TO IT'S OWN PEOPLE ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.
 

IN SPITE OF VAST NUMBERS OF "UFO SIGHTINGS", INNUMERABLE REPORTS OF "ALIEN ABDUCTIONS", AND "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS" WITH EXTRATERRESTRIALS THAT PERVADE NEARLY ALL OF PREHISTORIC AND RECORDED HUMAN HISTORY I FOUND ONLY ONE UNDERLYING, UNIFYING, UNDISPUTABLE, AXIOMATIC COMMON DENOMINATOR THAT PERMEATES ALL OF THIS DATA:
ASSUMING THAT SUBJECTIVE REALITY, OR BELIEFS, OF INDIVIDUALS IS ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE, THERE HAS BEEN NO UNIVERSALLY AGREED UPON "PROOF" THAT UFOS AND / OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FORMS EXIST WHETHER BASED ON GOVERNMENT ADMISSION , PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, CIRCUMSTANTIAL OR SUBJECTIVE DATA.


THERE ARE SEVERAL DEDUCTIONS I CAN INFER FROM THE LACK OF AGREEMENT, GOVERNMENT ADMISSION OR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUCH THINGS ARE REAL THAT, IF VERIFIED, MAY LEAD TO A WORKABLE SOLUTION TO THIS MYSTERY:

DEDUCTION:
IN SPITE OF AN ENORMOUS COLLECTION OF SUBJECTIVE, CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND OBJECTIVE "EVIDENCE" OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ACTIVITY ON AND AROUND EARTH, THE EXISTENCE, INTENTIONS AND THE ACTIVITIES OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS REMAIN HIDDEN AND MYSTERIOUS.

DEDUCTION:
UNIVERSALLY AGREED UPON PROOF OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE BASED ON SUBJECTIVE DATA, GOVERNMENT ADMISSION, PHYSICAL AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ARE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING VESTED INTERESTS, WHICH HAS MADE SUCH PROOF UNATTAINABLE.

COLLECTIVELY, THESE DEDUCTIONS BEG THE OBVIOUS QUESTION: IF EXTRATERRESTRIALS LIFE FORMS EXIST, WHY IS THERE NO CONSISTENT, FORTHRIGHT, OPEN, INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MANKIND AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS?


FORTUNATELY, SUBJECTIVE REALITY DOES NOT REQUIRE EVIDENCE OR "PROOF". THEREFORE, I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS BOOK IN ORDER TO PASS ALONG A SUBJECTIVE COMMUNICATION I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN IT.


PERSONALLY, I AM NOT ASSUMING THAT ANYTHING I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY IS IN ANY WAY AUTHENTIC, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ENVELOPE AND THE PAPER INSIDE THE ENVELOPE. I CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE ANY OF IT. INDEED, I CAN'T TRULY VERIFY THAT THERE WAS EVER SUCH A PERSON AS MRS. MACELROY OTHER THAN A VOICE I HEARD OVER THE PHONE IN 1998. THE VOICE COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE.

 

PERSONALLY, I DO NOT HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN UFO RESEARCH. YES, I'VE WRITTEN A FEW BOOKS ABOUT IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS - BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT. BUT I HAVEN'T SOLD ENOUGH OF THOSE BOOKS TO PAY FOR THE TIME IT TOOK TO WRITE THEM. IT IS A HOBBY. I EARN MY LIVING AS A SMALL BUSINESS CONSULTANT.


IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO JUSTIFY, EXPLAIN, OR REMEDY ANY DISABILITY TO PERCEIVE OR UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERIES OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL EXISTENCE, UFOS, GOVERNMENTS AGENDAS OR SPIRITUAL ABILITIES. NOR IS IT INTENDED TO EDUCATE, PERSUADE, OR PROMOTE TO ANYONE THAT ANY OF THESE PHENOMENA EXIST. FURTHERMORE, WHAT I MAY OR MAY NOT THINK ABOUT ANY OF THIS IS IRRELEVANT.


MOREOVER, I HAVE BURNED ALL OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE ENVELOPE I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY. I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE BEING HOUNDED BY UFO RESEARCHERS, GOVERNMENT AGENTS, GROCERY STORE TABLOIDS REPORTERS, UFO ADVOCATES AND DE-BUNKERS ALIKE, OR ANYONE ELSE. ANY "PROOFS" OR ATTEMPTS TO AUTHENTICATE THE ASSERTION THAT MRS. MACELROY ACTUALLY INTERVIEWED AN ALIEN IN 1947 WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BY OTHERS.

.1..."WAR OF THE WORLDS, AND THE INVASION FROM MARS"..."


"... THE DAY BEFORE HALLOWEEN, ON OCT. 30, 1938, WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TUNED IN TO A POPULAR RADIO PROGRAM THAT FEATURED PLAYS DIRECTED BY, AND OFTEN STARRING, ORSON WELLES. THE PERFORMANCE THAT EVENING WAS AN ADAPTATION OF THE SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, ABOUT A MARTIAN INVASION OF THE EARTH. BUT IN ADAPTING THE BOOK FOR A RADIO PLAY, WELLES MADE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE: UNDER HIS DIRECTION THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN AND PERFORMED SO IT WOULD SOUND LIKE A NEWS BROADCAST ABOUT AN INVASION FROM MARS, A TECHNIQUE THAT, PRESUMABLY, WAS INTENDED TO HEIGHTEN THE DRAMATIC EFFECT.


AS THE PLAY UNFOLDED, DANCE MUSIC WAS INTERRUPTED A NUMBER OF TIMES BY FAKE NEWS BULLETINS REPORTING THAT A "HUGE FLAMING OBJECT" HAD DROPPED ON A FARM NEAR GROVERS MILL, NEW JERSEY. AS MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE SAT ON THE EDGE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE SEAT, ACTORS PLAYING NEWS ANNOUNCERS, OFFICIALS AND OTHER ROLES ONE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR IN A NEWS REPORT, DESCRIBED THE LANDING OF AN INVASION FORCE FROM MARS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE BROADCAST ALSO CONTAINED A NUMBER OF EXPLANATIONS THAT IT WAS ALL A RADIO PLAY, BUT IF MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE MISSED A BRIEF EXPLANATION AT THE BEGINNING, THE NEXT ONE DIDN'T ARRIVE UNTIL 40 MINUTES INTO THE PROGRAM.


AT ONE POINT IN THE BROADCAST, AN ACTOR IN A STUDIO, PLAYING A NEWSCASTER IN THE FIELD, DESCRIBED THE EMERGENCE OF ONE OF THE ALIENS FROM ITS SPACECRAFT. "GOOD HEAVENS, SOMETHING'S WRIGGLING OUT OF THE SHADOW LIKE A GRAY SNAKE," HE SAID, IN AN APPROPRIATELY DRAMATIC TONE OF VOICE. "NOW IT'S ANOTHER ONE, AND ANOTHER. THEY LOOK LIKE TENTACLES TO ME. THERE, I CAN SEE THE THING'S BODY. IT'S LARGE AS A BEAR AND IT GLISTENS LIKE WET LEATHER. BUT THAT FACE. IT...IT'S INDESCRIBABLE. I CAN HARDLY FORCE MYSELF TO KEEP LOOKING AT IT. THE EYES ARE BLACK AND GLEAM LIKE A SERPENT. THE MOUTH IS V-SHAPED WITH SALIVA DRIPPING FROM ITS RIMLESS LIPS THAT SEEM TO QUIVER AND PULSATE....THE THING IS RAISING UP. THE CROWD FALLS BACK. THEY'VE SEEN ENOUGH. THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE. I CAN'T FIND WORDS. I'M PULLING THIS MICROPHONE WITH ME AS I TALK. I'LL HAVE TO STOP THE DESCRIPTION UNTIL I'VE TAKEN A NEW POSITION. HOLD ON, WILL YOU PLEASE, I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE."


AS IT LISTENED TO THIS SIMULATION OF A NEWS BROADCAST THE AUDIENCE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS HEARING AN ACTUAL NEWS ACCOUNT OF AN INVASION FROM MARS. PEOPLE PACKED THE ROADS, HID IN CELLARS, LOADED GUNS, EVEN WRAPPED THEIR HEADS IN WET TOWELS AS PROTECTION FROM MARTIAN POISON GAS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST ALIENS, OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ACTING OUT THE ROLE OF THE PANIC-STRICKEN PUBLIC THAT ACTUALLY BELONGED IN A RADIO PLAY.


NEWS OF THE PANIC (WHICH WAS CONVEYED VIA GENUINE NEWS REPORTS) QUICKLY GENERATED A NATIONAL SCANDAL. THERE WERE CALLS, WHICH NEVER WENT ANYWHERE, FOR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS OF BROADCASTING TO ENSURE THAT A SIMILAR INCIDENT WOULDN T HAPPEN AGAIN.
IN A PRESCIENT COLUMN, IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE, DOROTHY THOMPSON FORESAW THAT THE BROADCAST REVEALED THE WAY POLITICIANS COULD USE THE POWER OF MASS COMMUNICATIONS TO CREATE THEATRICAL ILLUSIONS, TO MANIPULATE THE PUBLIC."

"MAJESTIC 12" OR "MJ-12". (NOTE: ALL OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AND/OR ASSERTIONS CONCERNING THE MJ-12 DOCUMENTS ARE THOSE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: HTTP://WWW.MAJESTICDOCUMENTS.COM/)


"OPERATION MAJESTIC-12 WAS ESTABLISHED BY SPECIAL CLASSIFIED PRESIDENTIAL ORDER ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1947 AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES FORRESTAL AND DR. VANNEVAR BUSH, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD. THE GOAL OF THE GROUP WAS TO EXPLOIT EVERYTHING THEY COULD FROM RECOVERED ALIEN TECHNOLOGY.


BURIED IN A SUPER-SECRET "MAJIC EYES ONLY" CLASSIFICATION THAT WAS ABOVE TOP SECRET — LONG BEFORE THE MODERN TOP SECRET CODEWORD SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMS OF TODAY — MAJOR GENERAL LESLIE R. GROVES (WHO COMMANDED THE MANHATTAN PROJECT TO DELIVER THE ATOMIC BOMB) KEPT JUST ONE COPY OF THE DETAILS OF CRASHED ALIEN TECHNOLOGY IN HIS SAFE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.


AMBITIOUS, ELITE SCIENTISTS SUCH AS VANNEVAR BUSH, ALBERT EINSTEIN, AND ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, AND CAREER MILITARY PEOPLE SUCH AS HOYT VANDENBERG, ROSCOE HILLENKOETTER, LESLIE GROVES, AND GEORGE MARSHALL, ALONG WITH A SELECT CAST OF OTHER EXPERTS, FEVERISHLY AND SECRETIVELY LABORED TO UNDERSTAND THE ALIEN AGENDA, TECHNOLOGY, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS.


EINSTEIN AND OPPENHEIMER WERE CALLED IN TO GIVE THEIR OPINION, DRAFTING A SIX-PAGE PAPER TITLED "RELATIONSHIPS WITH INHABITANTS OF CELESTIAL BODIES." THEY PROVIDED PROPHETIC INSIGHT INTO OUR MODERN NUCLEAR STRATEGIES AND SATELLITES, AND EXPRESSED AGITATED URGENCY THAT AN AGREEMENT BE REACHED WITH THE PRESIDENT SO THAT SCIENTISTS COULD PROCEED TO STUDY THE ALIEN TECHNOLOGY.


THE EXTRAORDINARY RECOVERY OF FALLEN AIRBORNE OBJECTS IN THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO, BETWEEN JULY 4 - JULY 6, 1947, CAUSED THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMY AIR FORCE'S INTERPLANETARY PHENOMENA UNIT, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL BRANCH, COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE TO INITIATE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. THE SPECIAL UNIT WAS FORMED IN 1942 IN RESPONSE TO TWO CRASHES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA IN LATE FEBRUARY 1942. THE DRAFT SUMMARY REPORT BEGINS "AT 2332 MST, 3 JULY 47, RADAR STATIONS IN EAST TEXAS AND WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND, N. M. TRACKED TWO UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY BOTH DROPPED OFF RADAR. TWO CRASH SITES HAVE BEEN LOCATED CLOSE TO THE WSPG. SITE LZ-1 WAS LOCATED AT A RANCH NEAR CORONA, APPROX. 75 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE TOWN OF ROSWELL. SITE LZ-2 WAS LOCATED APPROX. 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE TOWN OF SOCORRO, AT LATITUDE 33-40-31 AND LONGITUDE 106-28-29".


THE FIRST-EVER-KNOWN UFO CRASH RETRIEVAL CASE OCCURRED IN 1941 IN CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI. THIS CRASH KICKED OFF EARLY REVERSE-ENGINEERING WORK, BUT IT DID NOT CREATE A UNIFIED INTELLIGENCE EFFORT TO EXPLOIT POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGICAL GAINS APART FROM THE MANHATTAN PROJECT USES.
THE DEBRIS FROM THE PRIMARY FIELD OF THE 1947 CRASH 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO WAS CALLED ULAT-1 (UNIDENTIFIED LENTICULAR AERODYNE TECHNOLOGY), AND IT EXCITED METALLURGISTS WITH ITS UNHEARD-OF TENSILE AND SHEAR STRENGTHS. THE FUSION NUCLEAR (CALLED NEUTRONIC AT THAT TIME) ENGINE USED HEAVY WATER AND DEUTERIUM WITH AN ODDLY ARRANGED SERIES OF COILS, MAGNETS, AND ELECTRODES — DESCRIPTIONS THAT RESEMBLE THE "COLD FUSION" STUDIES OF TODAY.


HARRY TRUMAN KEPT THE TECHNICAL BRIEFING DOCUMENTS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 1947 FOR FURTHER STUDY, PONDERING THE CHALLENGES OF CREATING AND FUNDING A SECRET ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CIA EXISTED (ALTHOUGH THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE GROUP OR CIG DID EXIST) AND BEFORE THERE WAS A LEGAL PROCEDURE OF FUNDING NON-WAR OPERATIONS.


IN APRIL 1954, A GROUP OF SENIOR OFFICERS OF THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE ARMED FORCES GATHERED FOR ONE OF THE MOST SECRET AND SENSATIONAL BRIEFINGS IN HISTORY. THE SUBJECT WAS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS — NOT JUST A DISCUSSION OF SIGHTINGS, BUT HOW TO RECOVER CRASHED UFOS, WHERE TO SHIP THE PARTS, AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE OCCUPANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE "SPECIAL OPERATIONS MANUAL (SOM1-01) EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES TECHNOLOGY RECOVERY AND DISPOSAL," MAJESTIC-12 "RED TEAMS" MAPPED OUT UFO CRASH RETRIEVAL SCENARIOS WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN TO PRESS BLACKOUTS, BODY PACKAGING, AND LIVE ALIEN TRANSPORT, ISOLATION, AND CUSTODY.


MAJESTIC DOCUMENTS.COM IS NOT ANOTHER REHASH OF THE FAMOUS ROSWELL STORY — IT CONTAINS OVER 500 PAGES (AND GROWING) OF NEWLY SURFACED DOCUMENTS, MANY OF WHICH DATE YEARS BEFORE THE ROSWELL CRASH. UNLIKE OTHER WEBSITES, A CENTRAL THEME OF VALIDATING AUTHENTICITY IS WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE SITE WHILE TELLING THE EXCITING STORY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S WORK ON RETRIEVAL AND ANALYSIS OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL HARDWARE AND ALIEN LIFE FORMS FROM 1941 TO PRESENT."

3 "LIKE RIPLEY SAID..."
ROBERT LEROY RIPLEY (DECEMBER 25, 1893 - MAY 27, 1949) WAS A CARTOONIST, ENTREPRENEUR, AND AMATEUR ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO CREATED THE WORLD FAMOUS RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT! NEWSPAPER PANEL SERIES, FEATURING ODD BUT TRUE FACTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. SUBJECTS COVERED IN RIPLEY'S CARTOONS AND TEXT RANGED FROM SPORTS FEATS TO LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT UNUSUAL AND EXOTIC SITES, BUT WHAT ENSURED THE CONCEPT'S POPULARITY MAY HAVE BEEN THAT RIPLEY ALSO INCLUDED ITEMS SUBMITTED BY READERS, WHO SUPPLIED PHOTOGRAPHS OF A WIDE VARIETY OF SMALL TOWN AMERICAN TRIVIA, RANGING FROM UNUSUALLY SHAPED VEGETABLES TO ODDLY MARKED DOMESTIC ANIMALS, ALL DOCUMENTED BY PHOTOGRAPHS AND THEN ENGAGINGLY DEPICTED BY RIPLEY'S PROLIFIC PEN."

ABOUT THE SOURCE OF MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK


THE CONTENT OF THIS BOOK IS PRIMARILY EXCERPTED FROM THE LETTER, INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS AND PERSONAL NOTES I RECEIVED FROM THE LATE MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY. HER LETTER TO ME ASSERTS THAT THIS MATERIAL IS BASED ON HER RECOLLECTION OF COMMUNICATION WITH AN ALIEN BEING, WHO "SPOKE" WITH HER TELEPATHICALLY.

 

DURING JULY AND AUGUST OF 1947 SHE INTERVIEWED AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEING WHO SHE IDENTIFIES AS "AIRL", AND WHOM SHE CLAIMS WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER WHO WAS RECOVERED FROM A FLYER SAUCER THAT CRASHED NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO ON JULY 8TH, 1947.


OBVIOUSLY, ANYONE READING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOST FAMOUS, OR INFAMOUS, OF ALL "FLYING SAUCER" OR "ALIEN ENCOUNTER" EVENTS MUST NECESSARILY BE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS REGARDING:

THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT

THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT APPEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED EVENT!

I RECEIVED THE AFOREMENTIONED LETTER FROM MRS. MACELROY ON SEPTEMBER 14TH, 2007, TOGETHER WITH A PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS. THE PACKAGE CONTAINED THREE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS:

HAND-WRITTEN NOTES IN CURSIVE ON ORDINARY, LINED, 8 1/2" X 11"SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, WHICH I ASSUME HAD BEEN WRITTEN PERSONALLY BY MRS. MACELROY.

NOTES TYPED ON A MANUAL TYPEWRITER ON PLAIN, WHITE 20 LB. BOND PAPER, WHICH I AM ASSUME WERE PREPARED PERSONALLY BY HER. AT LEAST BOTH HAD THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN WRITTEN IN THE SAME HAND WRITING, AND / OR TYPED ON THE SAME TYPEWRITER CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT. THE WRITING IN THE NOTES I RECEIVED ALSO APPEARED TO BE THE SAME AS THE WRITING ON THE ADDRESS AND RETURN ADDRESS OF THE MANILA ENVELOPE I RECEIVED FROM NAVAN, IRELAND, WHICH WAS POSTMARKED ON 3 SEPTEMBER, 2007. SINCE I AM NOT A FORENSIC EXPERT, OR HANDWRITING ANALYST, MY OPINION IN THESE MATTER IS NOT A PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED JUDGMENT.

MANY PAGES OF TYPEWRITTEN TRANSCRIPTIONS OF HER INTERVIEW WITH THE ALIEN. THESE WERE OBVIOUSLY TYPED ON A DIFFERENT TYPEWRITER. THESE PAGES WERE TYPED ON A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PAPER AND SHOWED APPARENT SIGNS OF AGE AND REPEATED HANDLING.

NONE OF THESE NOTES WERE ASSEMBLED IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER, OR BY DATE, EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED BY A SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH OF PREAMBLE OR EXPLANATION BY HER, OR BY EXTRAPOLATION FROM THE CONTEXT OF THE PAGES.


VOLTAIRE 4 (FOOTNOTE) IS QUOTED AS HAVING SAID:

"HISTORY IS A MISSISSIPPI OF LIES".

ACCORDING TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE ALIEN IN THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS, SUPPLIED BY MRS. MACELROY, THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON OF HISTORY IS THAT MANY, MANY GODS HAVE BECOME MEN, BUT VERY FEW MEN, IF ANY, HAVE RETURNED TO BEING A GOD AGAIN.


ACCORDING TO THE ALIEN BEING - "AIRL" - IF ANYTHING HE / SHE / IT SUPPOSEDLY COMMUNICATED CAN BE TRUSTED - AND IF THE "TRANSLATION" OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS ALLEGED COMMUNICATION IS ACCURATE, THE HISTORY OF THIS UNIVERSE IS A "RIVER OF LIES" DOWN WHICH THE MIGHT AND FREEDOM OF ALL-POWERFUL, GOD-LIKE, IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS ENDED AND WAS LOST IN A SEA OF MATTER AND MORTALITY.


FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO THE VERY DIRECT AND UNDIPLOMATIC STATEMENTS MADE - WHICH SEEM TO EXPRESS THE "PERSONAL OPINION" OF THE ALIEN - IF ONE WERE TRAVELING THE FAR REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE IN SEARCH OF A PLACE CALLED "HELL", IT WOULD BE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF EARTH AND THE INHABITANTS IN ITS CURRENT CONDITION.
 

TO FURTHER COMPOUND, COMPLICATE AND MAGNIFY THE "INCREDIBLE" SOURCE OF THE "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTIONS" I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE:

BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON "TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION" BETWEEN THE ALIEN AND MRS. MACELROY

MANY OF THESE INTERVIEWS DISCUSS "PARANORMAL" ACTIVITIES OF "IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS"

OF COURSE, MOST "SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITIES" ARE UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR PERCEIVE SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA OF ANY KIND.


THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF THE WORD PARANORMAL IS:

ADJECTIVE:
1. CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS
2. SUPERNATURAL, OR SEEMINGLY OUTSIDE "NORMAL" SENSORY CHANNELS

BY DEFINITION, PEOPLE WHO USE THE WORD "PARANORMAL" ARE 1) NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA AND 2) SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR NORMAL SENSORY CHANNELS.


IN SHORT, SCIENTISTS SUFFER FROM THE INABILITY AND/OR UNWILLINGNESS TO PERCEIVE AND/OR EXPLAIN SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, THE DISCUSSION OF SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES OR SPIRITUAL UNIVERSES IN THIS BOOK ARE EXPECTED TO BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY THOSE WHO CAN AND WILL PERCEIVE SUCH THINGS.


ACCORDING TO THE TIME SPANS RELATED BY THE ALIEN IN SEVERAL OF THE INTERVIEWS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPELLING AND HERETOFORE UNKNOWN REASONS THAT SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY EXTRAORDINARY MISCALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY EARTH SCIENTISTS REGARDING THE ORIGINS AND ANTIQUITY OF THE UNIVERSE, EARTH, LIFE FORMS AND EVENTS. OF COURSE, THESE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCURATE EITHER, AS TIME AND IT'S UGLY STEP-CHILD, HISTORY, ARE LARGELY SUBJECTIVE.


HOWEVER, IT CAN BE OBSERVED THAT, BY CONTRAST WITH INTERSTELLAR OR "MACROCOSMIC TIME", THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF RESIDENTS OF EARTH IS LIMITED TO A RELATIVELY MICROSCOPIC PERIOD OF TIME, COMPARED TO WHAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE "RECENT EVENTS" IN THE CHRONOLOGY OF AN SPACE TRAVEL CIVILIZATION, MUCH LESS THE ENTIRE TIME SPAN OF THE UNIVERSE.


THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD OF EARTH IS RECKONED, BY THE BEST GUESSES OF SCIENTISTS, TO BE ONLY ABOUT 4 BILLION YEARS. THE ANTIQUITY OF HOMO SAPIENS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY TEXTBOOKS IS ESTIMATED AT ONLY A FEW MILLION YEARS, AT MOST. EVEN THE ENTIRE BIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE EXISTED ON THIS PLANET FOR ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MILLION YEARS. AND, BY AND LARGE, THE PERSONAL MEMORY OF INDIVIDUAL BEINGS ON THIS PLANET IS LIMITED TO ONLY ONE LIFETIME.


ALL OTHER DATES, EVENTS, OR INTERPRETATIONS OF EVENTS CITED IN THIS BOOK ARE FROM TERRESTRIAL SOURCES, WHICH ARE PURELY SUBJECTIVE OBSERVATIONS, CONJECTURES, OR INVENTIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE AUTHOR, AND MUST THEREFORE BE CREDITED OR DISREGARDED BY THE READER ACCORDINGLY, CONSIDERING THE PENCHANT OF EARTH INHABITANTS TO MYOPIA, EGOCENTRICITY, AND GENERAL IGNORANCE OF THE SEVERAL UNIVERSES IN WHICH WE DWELL.


THIS BOOK IS INTENDED TO BE AN INFORMAL PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO ME, SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE FACT, OF A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS BETWEEN AN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT OFFICER, PILOT & ENGINEER AND AN ARMY AIR FORCE SURGICAL NURSE.

MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION

SINCE I HAVE NEVER MET MRS. MACELROY IN PERSON, AND SPOKE WITH HER OVER THE PHONE ONLY ONCE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, I CAN NOT VOUCH PERSONALLY FOR HER AS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. IN FACT, I CANNOT FACTUALLY SUBSTANTIATE THAT SUCH A PERSON ACTUALLY EXISTED, ACCEPT THAT I DID SPEAK WITH HER ON THE PHONE AND I RECEIVED HAND-WRITTEN MATERIAL IN THE MAIL WHICH WAS SENT FROM A PHYSICAL ADDRESS IN IRELAND.


WHEN I SPOKE TO HER ON THE PHONE IN 1998, I WAS LIVING IN FLORIDA. AT THE TIME OF OUR BRIEF PHONE INTERVIEW, MRS. MACELROY LIVED ON SCOTTY PRIDE DRIVE IN GLASGOW, MONTANA. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I MAILED A COPY OF MY BOOK, THE OZ FACTORS, TO HER AS A GIFT AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1999. I AM SURE SHE RECEIVED THE BOOK, BECAUSE SHE REFERS TO IT BY NAME IN THE LETTER I RECEIVED FROM IRELAND, AND SAYS THAT SHE READ IT.


I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET ABOUT GLASGOW, MONTANA FOR MY OWN INTEREST. GLASGOW WAS FOUNDED IN 1887 AS A RAILROAD TOWN THAT BECAME POPULAR DURING THE 1930S BECAUSE PRESIDENT FDR REQUESTED THAT FORT PECK DAM BE CONSTRUCTED THERE WHICH BECAME A HUGE SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THE GLASGOW AREA. IN THE 1960S THE POPULATION FLOURISHED UP TO 12,000 BECAUSE OF GLASGOW AIR FORCE BASE (SAC), WHICH WAS USED DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT AND THE EARLIER PART OF THE 'COLD WAR'. THE BASE WAS DEACTIVATED AND CLOSED IN 1969.


WHEN I TALKED TO MRS. MACELROY ON THE PHONE SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD BEEN RELOCATED THERE BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE AFTER HER SERVICE WAS COMPLETED, AND THAT'S WHERE SHE MET HER HUSBAND, WHO WAS AN ENGINEER. I DON'T THINK SHE MENTIONED HIS FIRST NAME. HOWEVER, HE WORKED ON BUILDING THE FORT PECK DAM, WHICH CREATED THE MASSIVE FORT PECK LAKE. ALTHOUGH THE DAM WAS FINISHED IN 1940, HE WAS A GREAT FISHERMAN AND OUTDOORSMAN, SO HE STAYED IN THE AREA.

 

I GATHERED THAT THE IRISH HERITAGE OF THE PLACE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT DIDN'T PURSUE THAT POINT WITH HER. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY RECORD OF A "MACELROY" WHO WORKED AT THE DAM, BUT THE PERSONNEL RECORDS FROM THAT PERIOD ARE VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT AS FAR AS I CAN DETERMINE.


I CONTACTED HER DURING MY RESEARCH FOR THE OZ FACTORS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS LED TO BELIEVE, THROUGH A VERY CIRCUITOUS LINE OF INVESTIGATION, THAT THIS WOMEN
WAS SUSPECTED OF HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH ALIEN CONTACT AT AREA 51, OR THE ROSWELL CRASH SITE, OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.


THROUGH A SEQUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL INFERENCES AND ACCIDENTAL REFERRALS, I ACTUALLY FOUND HER NUMBER IN THE PHONE BOOK AND CALLED HER UP JUST ON THE CHANCE THAT THERE MIGHT REALLY BE SUCH A PERSON.


NEEDLESS TO SAY, WHEN I CALLED HER SHE WAS LESS THAN FORTHCOMING IN HER RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, I THINK SHE WAS IMPRESSED BY MY GENUINE AND INNOCENT SINCERITY TO GET INFORMATION FOR MY BOOK, AND REALIZED THAT I HAD NO NEFARIOUS OR FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED PURPOSES OR REASON TO EXPLOIT HER IN ANY WAY.

 

NONETHELESS, SHE DID NOT GIVE ME ANY USEFUL INFORMATION AT THAT TIME, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE ARMY AND WAS STATIONED IN NEW MEXICO IN 1947.
SHE COULD NOT DISCUSS ANYTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT ANY KIND OF INCIDENT, AS HER LIFE DEPENDED ON REMAINING SILENT. ALTHOUGH THIS PIQUED MY INTEREST EVEN MORE, IT WAS FUTILE TO TRY TO PUSH HER ANY FURTHER, SO I GAVE UP AND FORGOT ABOUT HER UNTIL LAST SEPTEMBER, WHEN I GOT THE PACKAGE FROM IRELAND.


I TRIED TO CONTACT HER IN IRELAND AT THE RETURN ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE, BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY FROM HER, NOR HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANYONE IN MEATH COUNTY, IRELAND WHO WAS ACQUAINTED WITH EITHER OF THEM EXCEPT THE LANDLADY FROM WHOM THEY RENTED A ROOM FOR A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THEIR DEATHS, WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO REAL EVIDENCE OF THIS.


HOWEVER, THE POST MARK OF THE ENVELOPE SHE SENT TO ME WAS STAMPED AT THE POST OFFICE IN NAVAN, CO. MEATH, IRELAND ON THE DATE SITED ABOVE. SINCE THERE IS AN ACTUAL RESIDENCE (ACCORDING TO GOOGLE MAPS) AT THE RETURN ADDRESS SHOWN ON THE ENVELOPE, I WROTE TO THE ADDRESS AND WAS ADVISED BY THE HOME OWNER THAT BOTH MRS. MACELROY AND HER HUSBAND, WHOSE NAME TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN "PAUL", WERE BOTH RECENTLY DECEASED. SHE SAID THAT THE CREMATED REMAINS OF MRS. MACELROY AND HER HUSBAND WERE INTERRED AT SAINT FINIAN CEMETERY ON ATHBOY ROAD.


SUBSEQUENTLY, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY RECORD OF HER UNDER THE MAIDEN NAME OF O'DONNELL, NOR HAVE I HAD ANY SUCCESS AT DISCOVERING ANY PERSONAL FRIEND, FAMILY MEMBER OR DOCUMENT TO CONFIRM HER BIRTH, MEDICAL EDUCATION, OR MILITARY RECORD, MARRIAGE OR DEATH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER LANDLADY IN IRELAND (WHO IS NOT A RELATIVE) JUST BEFORE HER DEATH. I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS THE FALSE IDENTITY GIVEN TO HER BY THE MILITARY WHEN SHE LEFT ROSWELL, AS MENTIONED IN HER NOTES.


IN EITHER CASE, IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HER IDENTITY AND ALL EVIDENCE OF HER HAS BEEN EXPUNGED FROM THE PUBLIC RECORD. I UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAIN GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES ARE ADEPT AT COVERING UP EVIDENCE, OR MAKING RECORDS (AND PEOPLE) DISAPPEAR. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN HER CASE, DUE TO THE HIGHLY SENSITIVE NATURE OF THE ROSWELL INCIDENT AND CONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE ALLEGED "COVER UP".


INASMUCH AS I DO NOT HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION TO VERIFY OR SUBSTANTIATE THAT ANY OF THE NOTES OF THESE "INTERVIEWS" SENT TO ME BY MRS. MACELROY ARE IN ANY WAY FACTUAL, OTHER THAN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED, LET THE READER BEWARE, AND TAKE HEED ACCORDINGLY!

THE LETTER FROM MRS. MACELROY

AUGUST 12, 2007

DEAR LAWRENCE,


I AM TYPING THIS LETTER TO YOU ON MY OLD UNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER THAT I BOUGHT AFTER I WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY. SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKE A FITTING CONTRAST TO THE SUBJECT OF THIS LETTER AND THE DOCUMENTS YOU WILL FIND ENCLOSED IN THIS ENVELOPE.


THE LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU WAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. DURING YOUR BRIEF TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH ME YOU ASKED ME TO ASSIST YOU WITH THE RESEARCH FOR "THE OZ FACTORS" BOOK YOU WERE WRITING BECAUSE YOU SUSPECTED THAT I MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP YOUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBILITY THAT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE HISTORY OF EARTH. WHEN WE SPOKE, I TOLD YOU THAT I DID NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT I COULD SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT ANYTHING.


SINCE THEN I HAVE READ YOUR BOOK AND FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING AND COMPELLING. YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A MAN WHO HAS DONE HIS HOMEWORK, AND WHO COULD UNDERSTAND MY OWN EXPERIENCES. I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT YOUR ALLUSION TO THE OLD PHILOSOPHER WHOM YOU PARAPHRASED IN OUR PHONE CONVERSATION: "WITH GREAT POWER, COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY". ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK POWER IS PERTINENT IN MY LIFE OR TO MY REASONS FOR SENDING YOU THE ENCLOSED DOCUMENTS, YOU CERTAINLY DID GET ME THINKING ABOUT MY RESPONSIBILITY.


I HAVE RECONSIDERED MY POSITION, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS MY REALIZATION THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. I DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MYSELF, AT LEAST. I CAN NOT POSSIBLY TELL YOU THE PERSONAL HELL 5 (FOOTNOTE) OF ETHICAL IRRESOLUTION AND SPIRITUAL AMBIVALENCE I HAVE ENDURED SINCE 1947. I DO NOT WANT TO KEEP PLAYING THE GAME OF "MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE, OR MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE", THROUGH THE REST OF ETERNITY!


MANY MEN HAVE BEEN KILLED TO EXTINGUISH THE POSSIBILITY OF REVEALING THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE HELPED TO WITHHOLD FROM SOCIETY, UNTIL NOW. ONLY A SMALL HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ON EARTH HAVE SEEN AND HEARD WHAT I HAVE HAD THE BURDEN OF KEEPING SECRET FOR SIXTY YEARS. ALL THOSE YEARS I THOUGHT THAT I HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE BY THE "POWERS THAT BE" IN OUR GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH I HAVE OFTEN FELT THAT POWER IS GREATLY MISGUIDED, TO "PROTECT" MANKIND FROM THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT, NOT ONLY DO INTELLIGENT EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FORMS EXIST, BUT THAT THEY HAVE AND CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY MONITOR AND INVADE THE LIVES OF EVERYONE ON EARTH EVERY DAY.


THEREFORE, I THINK THE TIME HAS COME TO PASS ALONG MY SECRET KNOWLEDGE TO SOMEONE I THINK WILL UNDERSTAND IT. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE OF ME TO TAKE THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE INTO THE SILENT AFTERLIFE, BEYOND REACH OR RECOGNITION. I THINK THERE IS A GREATER GOOD TO BE SERVED THAN PROTECTING THE "VESTED INTERESTS" FOR WHOM THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED A MATTER OF "NATIONAL SECURITY", WHATEVER THAT MEANS, AND IS THEREFORE JUSTIFICATION FOR MAKING IT "TOP SECRET". 6 (FOOTNOTE)


ALSO, I AM NOW 83 YEARS OLD. I HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THIS BODY, WHICH HAS OUTLASTED IT'S USEFULNESS TO ME, USING A PAINLESS METHOD OF SELF-ADMINISTERED EUTHANASIA. 7 (FOOTNOTE) I HAVE A VERY FEW MONTHS TO LIVE, AND NOTHING TO FEAR OR LOSE.


SO, I HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM MONTANA, WHERE MY HUSBAND AND I LIVED FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, TO SPEND OUR REMAINING DAYS IN A LOVELY RENTED UPSTAIRS BEDROOM IN A HOUSE IN THE HOMELAND OF MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY IN COUNTY MEATH, IRELAND. 8 (FOOTNOTE)


I WILL DIE NOT FAR FROM "THE GREAT MOUND" AT KNOWTH 9 (FOOTNOTE), AND DOWTH, THE "FAIRY MOUND OF DARKNESS". THESE ARE SACRED "CAIRNS" OR MASSIVE STONE STRUCTURES THAT WERE ERECTED ABOUT 3,700 BCE AND ENGRAVED WITH INDECIPHERABLE HIEROGLYPHS - ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS PYRAMIDS AND OTHER INEXPLICABLE STONE MONUMENTS WERE BEING BUILT ALL OVER THE EARTH.


I AM ALSO NOT FAR FROM "THE HILL OF TARA", 10 (FOOTNOTE) THAT WAS ONCE THE ANCIENT SEAT OF POWER IN IRELAND WHERE 142 KINGS ARE SAID TO HAVE REIGNED IN PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC TIMES. IN ANCIENT IRISH RELIGION AND MYTHOLOGY THIS WAS THE SACRED PLACE OF DWELLING FOR THE "GODS" AND WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE "OTHER WORLD".


SAINT PATRICK CAME TO TARA TO CONQUER THE ANCIENT RELIGION OF THE PAGANS. HE MAY HAVE SUPPRESSED THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES IN THE AREA, BUT HE CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE "GODS" WHO BROUGHT THESE CIVILIZATIONS TO EARTH, AS YOU WILL DISCOVER WHEN YOU READ THE DOCUMENTS ENCLOSED. THEREFORE, THIS IS A FITTING LOCATION FOR MY DEPARTURE FROM THIS UNHOLY WORLD AND FINAL RELEASE FROM THE BURDENS OF THIS LIFE.


THE CRYSTAL CLEAR PERSPECTIVE OF HINDSIGHT HAS REVEALED A HIGHER PURPOSE TO ME: ASSISTING THE SURVIVAL OF THE PLANET, ALL LIVING BEINGS AND LIFE FORMS IN OUR GALAXY!


THE STATUS QUO OF OUR GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENT HAS BEEN TO "PROTECT THE PEOPLE" FROM KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH MATTERS. IN FACT, THE ONLY PROTECTION AFFORDED BY IGNORANCE AND SECRECY IS TO HIDE THE PRIVATE AGENDA OF THOSE IN POWER TO ENSLAVE OTHERS. AND, BY DOING SO, TO DISARM EVERY PERCEIVED ENEMY, AND ALLY, THROUGH SUPERSTITION AND STUPIDITY.


THEREFORE, I HAVE ENCLOSED THE ORIGINAL AND ONLY EXISTING COPIES OF MY PERSONAL NOTES AND REFLECTIONS ON A MATTER WHICH I HAVE KEPT HIDDEN FROM EVERYONE, EVEN MY OWN FAMILY. I HAVE ALSO ENCLOSED MY COPIES OF TYPED TRANSCRIPTS CREATED BY THE STENOGRAPHER WHO TRANSCRIBED ALL OF MY INTERVIEWS WITH THE ALIEN SAUCER PILOT AFTER EACH INTERVIEW WAS FINISHED. I DO NOT HAVE ANY COPIES OF THE TAPE RECORDINGS THAT WERE MADE OF MY INTERVIEW REPORTS. NO ONE, UNTIL NOW, KNOWS THAT I WAS ABLE TO SECRETLY RETAIN COPIES OF THE OFFICIAL INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS.


NOW I AM ENTRUSTING THESE DOCUMENTS TO YOUR DISCRETION TO IMPART TO THE WORLD IN ANY FORM OR MANNER YOU SEE FIT. MY ONLY REQUEST IS THAT YOU DO SO IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT THREATEN YOUR OWN LIFE OR WELL BEING, IF POSSIBLE. IF YOU WERE TO INCORPORATE THESE NOTES OF MY EXPERIENCES INTO A WORK OF FICTION, SUCH AS A NOVEL, THE FACTUAL NATURE OF THE MATERIAL COULD BE EASILY DISMISSED OR DISCREDITED BY ANY AGENCY FOR WHOM "NATIONAL SECURITY" IS USED AS A PERSONAL SHIELD AGAINST SCRUTINY AND JUSTICE.


IN SO DOING, YOU COULD "DISAVOW ANY KNOWLEDGE" OF THEIR TRUE ORIGIN, AND CLAIM THAT IT IS A FICTITIOUS WORK OF YOUR IMAGINATION. WHOEVER SAID THAT "TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION" WAS "RIGHT AS RAIN". FOR MOST PEOPLE ALL OF THIS WILL BE "UNBELIEVABLE". UNFORTUNATELY, BELIEFS ARE NOT A RELIABLE CRITERIA FOR REALITY.


ALSO, I AM SURE THAT IF YOU WERE TO SHOW THESE NOTES TO ANYONE THAT WOULD PREFER PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC OR SPIRITUAL SLAVERY OVER FREEDOM, THE SUBJECT MATTER CONTAINED IN THEM WOULD SEEM QUITE OBJECTIONABLE. IF YOU ATTEMPTED TO PUBLISHED THE DOCUMENTS AS A MATTER OF FACTUAL REPORTING IN A NEWSPAPER OR ON THE EVENING TV NEWS THEY WOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND AS THE WORK OF A KOOK. THE VERY NATURE OF THESE DOCUMENTS MAKE THEM UNBELIEVABLE, AND THEREFORE DISCREDITABLE. CONVERSELY, THE RELEASE OF THIS INFORMATION IS POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC FOR CERTAIN POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS AND ECONOMIC VESTED INTERESTS.


THESE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN INFORMATION WHICH IS QUITE RELEVANT TO YOUR INTEREST AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALIEN ENCOUNTERS AND PARANORMAL EXPERIENCE. TO USE YOUR ANALOGY IN "THE OZ FACTORS" BOOK, I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THE FEW FACTUAL REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY OTHERS ABOUT "ALIEN" INFLUENCES ARE ONLY A GENTLE BREEZE IN THE EYE OF AN APOCALYPTIC HURRICANE SWIRLING AROUND EARTH. THERE REALLY ARE WIZARDS AND WICKED WITCHES AND FLYING MONKEYS IN THIS UNIVERSE!


THIS INFORMATION, WHICH HAS BEEN SUSPECTED AND/OR SPECULATED UPON BY SO MANY FOR SO LONG, HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY DENIED BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA, ACADEMIA, AND THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX 11 (FOOTNOTE) THAT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WARNED US ABOUT IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS.

AS YOU KNOWN IN JULY,1947,THE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD (RAAF) 12 (FOOTNOTE) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE STATING THAT PERSONNEL FROM THE FIELD'S 509TH BOMB GROUP HAD RECOVERED A CRASHED "FLYING DISC" FROM A RANCH NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, SPARKING INTENSE MEDIA INTEREST. 13 (FOOTNOTE)


LATER THE SAME DAY, THE COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE 14 (FOOTNOTE) STATED THAT MAJOR JESSE MARCEL, WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE ORIGINAL RECOVERY OF THE DEBRIS, HAD RECOVERED ONLY THE TATTERED REMNANTS OF A WEATHER BALLOON. THE TRUE FACTS OF THE INCIDENT HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SINCE THEN.


YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT I WAS ENLISTED IN THE U.S. WOMEN'S ARMY AIR FORCE (WAC) 15 (FOOTNOTE) MEDICAL CORP WHICH WAS A PART OF THE US ARMY BACK THEN. I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE 50 9TH BOMB GROUP AS A FLIGHT NURSE 16 (FOOTNOTE) AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.


WHEN THE NEWS THAT THERE HAD BEEN A CRASH WAS RECEIVED AT THE BASE, I WAS ASKED TO ACCOMPANY MR. CAVITT, THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 17 (FOOTNOTE) TO THE CRASH SITE AS THE DRIVER OF HIS VEHICLE, AND TO RENDER ANY NEEDED EMERGENCY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY SURVIVORS, IF NECESSARY. 18 (FOOTNOTE)

 

THEREFORE, I BRIEFLY WITNESSED THE WRECKAGE OF AN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT, AS WELL AS THE REMAINS OF THE SEVERAL ALIEN PERSONNEL ABOARD THE CRAFT WHO WERE ALREADY DEAD.


WHEN WE ARRIVED I LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE PERSONNEL ON BOARD THE CRAFT HAD SURVIVED THE CRASH, AND WAS CONSCIOUS, AND APPARENTLY UNINJURED. THE CONSCIOUS ALIEN WAS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE, BUT NOT THE SAME AS, THE OTHERS. 19 (FOOTNOTE)


NONE OF THE OTHER PERSONNEL PRESENT COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE SURVIVOR, AS THE BEING DID NOT COMMUNICATE VERBALLY OR BY ANY RECOGNIZABLE SIGNS. HOWEVER, WHILE I EXAMINED THE "PATIENT" FOR INJURIES I IMMEDIATELY DETECTED AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ALIEN BEING WAS ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME BY "MENTAL IMAGES", OR "TELEPATHIC THOUGHT", 20 (FOOTNOTE) WHICH PROJECTED DIRECTLY FROM THE MIND OF THE BEING.


I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS PHENOMENON TO MR. CAVITT. AS NO OTHER PERSON PRESENT COULD PERCEIVE THESE THOUGHTS, AND THE ALIEN SEEMED ABLE AND WILLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME, IT WAS DECIDED, AFTER A BRIEF CONSULTATION WITH A SENIOR OFFICER, THAT I WOULD ACCOMPANY THE SURVIVING ALIEN BACK TO THE BASE.


THIS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS A NURSE, AND COULD ATTEND TO THE PHYSICAL NEEDS OF THE ALIEN, AS WELL AS SERVE AS A NON-THREATENING COMMUNICATOR AND COMPANION. AFTER ALL, I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN AT THE SITE AND THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS NOT ARMED. I WAS THEREAFTER ASSIGNED PERMANENTLY TO SERVE AS A "COMPANION" OF THE ALIEN AT ALL TIMES. 21 (FOOTNOTE)


MY DUTY WAS TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND INTERVIEW THE ALIEN AND TO MAKE A COMPLETE REPORT OF ALL THAT I DISCOVERED TO COMMAND AUTHORITIES. SUBSEQUENTLY, I WAS SUPPLIED WITH SPECIFIC LISTS OF QUESTIONS PROVIDED TO ME BY MILITARY AND NON-MILITARY PERSONNEL, WHICH I WAS TO "INTERPRET" FOR THE ALIEN, AND RECORD THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS PROVIDED.


I ALSO ACCOMPANIED THE ALIEN AT ALL TIMES DURING MEDICAL TESTING AND THE MANY OTHER EXAMINATIONS TO WHICH THE ALIEN WAS SUBJECTED BY STAFF FROM NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.


I WAS GIVEN A PROMOTION IN RANK TO SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT TO IMPROVE MY SECURITY RATING, AND TO INCREASE MY PAY GRADE FROM $54.00 A MONTH TO $138.00 A MONTH, FOR THIS VERY UNUSUAL ASSIGNMENT. I PERFORMED THESE DUTIES FROM JULY 7TH THROUGH AUGUST,1947,AT WHICH TIME THE ALIEN "DIED" OR DEPARTED THE "BODY", AS YOU WILL READ ABOUT IN MY NOTES.


ALTHOUGH I WAS NEVER LEFT ENTIRELY ALONE WITH THE ALIEN, AS THERE WERE ALWAYS MILITARY PERSONNEL, INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PEOPLE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER OFFICIALS PRESENT FROM TIME TO TIME, I DID HAVE UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS TO AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE ALIEN BEING FOR NEARLY SIX WEEKS.


HEREINAFTER IS AN OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF MY PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF "CONVERSATIONS" WITH THE ALIEN CRAFT PILOT, WHOM I CAME TO KNOW BY THE IDENTITY OF "AIRL".


I FEEL THAT IT IS MY DUTY AT THIS TIME, IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITIZENS OF EARTH, TO REVEAL WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY INTERACTION WITH "AIRL" DURING THOSE SIX WEEKS, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER "DEATH" OR DEPARTURE SIXTY YEARS AGO.


ALTHOUGH I SERVED AS A NURSE IN THE ARMY AIR FORCE, I AM NOT A PILOT OR TECHNICIAN. FURTHER, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE SPACE CRAFT OR OTHER MATERIALS RECOVERED FROM THE CRASH SITE AT THAT TIME, OR THEREAFTER. TO THAT DEGREE IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNICATIONS I HAD WITH " AIRL" ARE BASED ON MY OWN SUBJECTIVE ABILITY TO INTERPRET THE MEANING OF THE THOUGHTS AND MENTAL IMAGES I WAS ABLE TO PERCEIVE.


OUR COMMUNICATION DID NOT CONSIST OF "SPOKEN LANGUAGE", IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE. INDEED, THE "BODY" OF THE ALIEN HAD NO "MOUTH" THROUGH WHICH TO SPEAK. OUR COMMUNICATION WAS BY TELEPATHY. AT FIRST, I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AIRL VERY CLEARLY. I COULD PERCEIVE IMAGES, EMOTIONS AND IMPRESSIONS, BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EXPRESS THESE VERBALLY. ONCE AIRL LEARNED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, SHE WAS ABLE TO FOCUS HER THOUGHTS MORE PRECISELY USING SYMBOLS AND MEANINGS OF WORDS I COULD UNDERSTAND. LEARNING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WAS DONE AS A FAVOR TO ME. IT WAS MORE FOR MY OWN BENEFIT THAN HERS.


BY THE END OF OUR INTERVIEW SESSIONS, AND INCREASINGLY SINCE THEN, I HAVE BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION. I HAVE BECOME MORE ADEPT AT UNDERSTANDING AIRL'S THOUGHTS AS THOUGH THEY ARE MY OWN. SOMEHOW, HER THOUGHTS BECOME MY THOUGHTS. HER EMOTIONS ARE MY EMOTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS IS LIMITED BY HER WILLINGNESS AND INTENTION TO SHARE HER OWN, PERSONAL UNIVERSE WITH ME. SHE IS ABLE TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT COMMUNICATION I AM ALLOWED TO RECEIVE FROM HER.

 

LIKEWISE, HER EXPERIENCE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RELATIONSHIPS AND PURPOSES ARE UNIQUELY HER OWN.
 


THIS IS THE SYMBOL OF "THE DOMAIN"
THE DOMAIN IS A RACE OR CIVILIZATION OF WHICH AIRL, THE ALIEN I INTERVIEWED, IS AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER SERVING IN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE. THE SYMBOL REPRESENTS THE ORIGIN AND UNLIMITED BOUNDARY OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE, UNITED AND INTEGRATED INTO A VAST CIVILIZATION UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DOMAIN.


AIRL IS CURRENTLY STATIONED AT A BASE IN THE ASTEROID BELT WHICH SHE REFERS AS A "SPACE STATION" IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM OF EARTH. FIRST AND FOREMOST, AIRL IS HERSELF. SECONDARILY, SHE VOLUNTARILY SERVES AS AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER IN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE. IN THAT CAPACITY SHE HAS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT SHE IS AT LEAVE TO COME AND GO AS SHE PLEASES ALSO.


PLEASE ACCEPT THIS MATERIAL AND MAKE IT KNOWN TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I REPEAT THAT IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO ENDANGER YOUR LIFE WITH THE POSSESSION OF THIS MATERIAL, NOR DO I REALLY EXPECT YOU TO BELIEVE ANY


OF IT EITHER. HOWEVER, I DO SENSE THAT YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE VALUE THAT SUCH KNOWLEDGE MAY HAVE TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO FACE THE REALITY OF
IT.
MANKIND NEEDS TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN THESE DOCUMENTS. WHO ARE WE? WHERE DID WE COME FROM? WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE ON EARTH? IS MANKIND ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? IF THERE IS INTELLIGENT LIFE ELSEWHERE WHY HAVE THEY NOT CONTACTED US?


IT IS VITAL THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES TO OUR SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL SURVIVAL IF WE FAIL TO TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO UNDO THE LONGSTANDING AND PERVASIVE EFFECTS OF ALIEN INTERVENTION ON EARTH.


PERHAPS THE INFORMATION IN THESE DOCUMENTS WILL SERVE AS A STEPPING STONE TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR MANKIND. I HOPE THAT YOU CAN BE MORE CLEVER, CREATIVE AND COURAGEOUS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS INFORMATION THAN I HAVE BEEN.


MAY THE GODS BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU.

HIPPOCRATES MENTIONS EUTHANASIA IN THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH, WHICH WAS WRITTEN BETWEEN 400 AND 300 B.C. THE ANCIENT GREEKS AND ROMANS GENERALLY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT LIFE NEEDED TO BE PRESERVED AT ANY COST AND WERE, IN CONSEQUENCE, TOLERANT OF SUICIDE IN CASES WHERE NO RELIEF COULD BE OFFERED TO THE DYING OR, IN THE CASE OF THE STOICS AND EPICUREANS, WHERE A PERSON NO LONGER CARED FOR HIS LIFE."

"THE ASTRONOMICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF KERBSTONE 51, THE "STONE OF THE SEVEN SUNS", AT DOWTH: IF MOONLIGHT WERE TO SHINE ON THE BACK STONE OF THE EASTERN PASSAGE AT KNOWTH, IT WOULD ILLUMINATE A MAP OF THE MOON ITSELF, THE WORLD'S OLDEST KNOWN DEPICTION OF THE LUNAR MARIA*. THE CARVINGS ARE ABOUT 4800 YEARS OLD. THE NEXT OLDEST DEPICTION OF THE MARIA KNOWN TO SCIENCE IS THAT BY LEONARDO DA VINCI IN ABOUT 1505 AD.
 

* LUNAR MARIA (SINGULAR: MARE, TWO SYLLABLES) ARE LARGE, DARK, BASALTIC PLAINS ON EARTH'S MOON, FORMED BY ANCIENT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. THEY WERE DUBBED MARIA, LATIN FOR "SEAS", BY EARLY ASTRONOMERS WHO MISTOOK THEM FOR ACTUAL SEAS. THEY ARE LESS REFLECTIVE THAN THE "HIGHLANDS" AS A RESULT OF THEIR IRON-RICH COMPOSITIONS, AND HENCE APPEAR DARK TO THE NAKED EYE. THE MARIA COVER ABOUT 16% OF THE LUNAR SURFACE, MOSTLY ON THE NEAR-SIDE VISIBLE FROM EARTH. THE FEW MARIA ON THE FAR-SIDE ARE MUCH SMALLER, RESIDING MOSTLY IN VERY LARGE CRATERS WHERE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF FLOODING OCCURRED. — REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA


THE MYTHOLOGY ABOUT DOWTH SPEAKS OF A HULL AND SEVEN COWS, IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE SITE HAS SOME CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTELLATION OF TAURUS, THE BULL, WHICH CONTAINS THE OPEN CLUSTER THE PLEIADES, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "THE SEVEN SISTERS". THIS CONSTELLATION WAS VERY IMPORTANT AROUND THE YEAR 3000BC, WHEN THE BOYNE VALLEY MOUNDS WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED, AS IT CONTAINED THE SUN ON THE SPRING EQUINOX, THAT VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT OF THE YEAR WHEN THE SUN'S PATH ALONG THE ECLIPTIC CROSSED THE CELESTIAL EQUATOR HEADING NORTHWARDS. IT IS THE SUN'S POSITION AMONG THE ZODIAC STARS AT THIS TIME WHICH DETERMINES THE CURRENT 'AGE' - I.E. THE "AGE OF TAURUS".


ANOTHER INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHICH OCCURS AT THIS TIME IS WHAT IS KNOWN TO ASTRONOMERS AS A 'HELIACAL RISING' OF THE PLEIADES. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE STARS IN QUESTION RISE AT THE EASTERN HORIZON BUT ARE QUICKLY LOST IN THE GLARE OF THE RISING SUN. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE EGYPTIANS, AND THE DOGON TRIBE IN AFRICA, (SEE: THE OZ FACTORS) AMONG OTHERS, USED THE SAME DOWTH-LIKE 'SUN-WHEEL' SYMBOLS TO SIGNIFY A HELIACAL RISING.
 

IF THESE 'SUN-WHEEL' SYMBOLS DO REPRESENT THE HELIACAL RISING OF THE PLEIADES, IT TELLS US SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE NEOLITHIC PEOPLE - THEY WERE AWARE OF THE GREAT CYCLE OF PRECESSION, THE SLOW WOBBLE OF THE EARTH'S AXIS WHICH CAUSES THE CELESTIAL POLE TO SHIFT OVER TIME, RESULTING IN THE VERNAL EQUINOX POINT, THAT PLACE WHERE THE SUN CROSSES THE CELESTIAL EQUATOR, MOVING BACKWARDS, OR WESTWARDS, THROUGH THE ZODIAC OVER A HUGE 25,800-YEAR PERIOD.

 

THIS VERNAL POINT MOVES JUST ONE DEGREE (ABOUT TWO WIDTHS OF THE FULL MOON) EVERY 72 YEARS, AND SPENDS ON AVERAGE 2,150 YEARS IN EACH OF THE TWELVE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE ZODIAC."

IT WAS SAID TO ROAR WHEN TOUCHED BY THE RIGHTFUL KING OF TARA.


A NEW THEORY SUGGESTS TARA WAS THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF THE LOST KINGDOM OF ATLANTIS. THE MYTHICAL LAND OF ATLANTIS WAS IRELAND, ACCORDING TO A NEW BOOK. THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF MONUMENTS AND EARTHEN STRUCTURES ON THE HILL OF TARA. THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT AT THE SITE WAS IN THE NEOLITHIC, AND THE MOUND OF THE HOSTAGES WAS CONSTRUCTED IN OR AROUND 2500BC."

11 "...THE MILITARY - INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THAT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WARNED US ABOUT IN
HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS..."


"A MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX (MIC) IS COMPOSED OF A NATION'S ARMED FORCES, ITS SUPPLIERS OF WEAPONS SYSTEMS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, AND ITS CIVIL GOVERNMENT.


THE TERM "MIC" IS MOST OFTEN USED IN REFERENCE TO THE UNITED STATES, WHERE IT GAINED POPULARITY AFTER ITS USE IN THE FAREWELL ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. IN THE PENULTIMATE DRAFT OF THE ADDRESS, EISENHOWER INITIALLY USED THE TERM MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL-CONQRESSIONAL COMPLEX, AND THUS INDICATED THE ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS PLAYS IN THE PROPAGATION OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRY. BUT, IT IS SAID, THAT THE PRESIDENT
CHOSE TO STRIKE THE WORD CONGRESSIONAL \R\ ORDER TO PLACATE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.


IT IS SOMETIMES USED MORE BROADLY TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE NETWORK OF CONTRACTS AND FLOWS OF MONEY AND RESOURCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONS OF THE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THE PENTAGON, AND THE CONGRESS AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS SECTOR IS INTRINSICALLY PRONE TO PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEM, MORAL HAZARD, AND RENT SEEKING. CASES OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION HAVE ALSO SURFACED WITH REGULARITY.


PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (AND FORMER GENERAL OF THE ARMY) DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER LATER USED THE TERM IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON JANUARY 17,1961:

"A VITAL ELEMENT IN KEEPING THE PEACE IS OUR MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT. OUR ARMS MUST BE MIGHTY, READY FOR INSTANT ACTION, SO THAT NO POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR MAY BE TEMPTED TO RISK HIS OWN DESTRUCTION...


THIS CONJUNCTION OF AN IMMENSE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AND A LARGE ARMS INDUSTRY IS NEW IN THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. THE TOTAL INFLUENCE — ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EVEN SPIRITUAL — IS FELT IN EVERY CITY, EVERY STATEHOUSE, EVERY OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPERATIVE NEED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT. YET WE MUST NOT FAIL TO COMPREHEND ITS GRAVE IMPLICATIONS. OUR TOIL, RESOURCES AND LIVELIHOOD ARE ALL INVOLVED; SO IS THE VERY STRUCTURE OF OUR SOCIETY.


IN THE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT, WE MUST GUARD AGAINST THE ACQUISITION OF UNWARRANTED INFLUENCE, WHETHER SOUGHT OR UNSOUGHT, BY THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DISASTROUS RISE OF MISPLACED POWER EXISTS AND WILL PERSIST.


WE MUST NEVER LET THE WEIGHT OF THIS COMBINATION ENDANGER OUR LIBERTIES OR DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. WE SHOULD TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. ONLY AN ALERT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE CITIZENRY CAN COMPEL THE PROPER MESHING OF THE HUGE INDUSTRIAL AND MILITARY MACHINERY OF DEFENSE WITH OUR PEACEFUL METHODS AND GOALS SO THAT SECURITY AND LIBERTY MAY PROSPER TOGETHER."

THE FOLLOWING LIST OF WITNESSES AND TESTIMONY REGARDING THE "CRASHED FLYING DISC" INCIDENT THAT MRS. MACELROY DESCRIBES IN HER LETTER:

NOTE: TESTIMONIAL, SIGNED AFFIDAVITS, PHOTOS AND OTHER RESOURCE MATERIALS ABOUT THE INCIDENT

CAN BE VIEWED AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: — HTTP://ROSWEL IPROOF .HORN ESTEAD. COM/INDEX, HTML
 

'WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CONTENTS OF THE MESSAGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH WITNESS TESTIMONY, THE EVIDENCE CLEARLY POINTS TO AN ACTUAL FLYING SAUCER CRASH, AS ASTONISHING AS THIS CONCLUSION MAY SEEM TO MANY.


THIS TESTIMONY IS GONE INTO IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL ELSEWHERE IN THIS WEBSITE. IT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NUMEROUS AND CONSISTENT DESCRIPTIONS OF HIGHLY ANOMALOUS DEBRIS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT OF ALIEN BODIES. HERE ARE A FEW KEY WITNESSES:


MAJOR JESSE MARCEL: THEN THE INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AT ROSWELL AND THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE SHEEP RANCHER MACK BRAZEL'S FIND, MARCEL CONFIRMED IN A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS 30 YEARS LATER THAT THE CRASH DEBRIS HAD HIGHLY ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES AND WAS "NOT OF THIS EARTH." MARCEL ALSO SPOKE OF RAMEY'S WEATHER BALLOON COVER-UP AT FORT WORTH. NOTE PARTICULARLY HIGHLY LAUDATORY POST-ROSWELL EVALUATIONS BY BASE COMMANDER COL. WILLIAM BLANCHARD, GEN. RAMEY, AND MURE USAF CHIEF OF STAFF COL. JOHN RYAN.


LT WALTER HAUT FORMER ROSWELL BASE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER WHO ISSUED THE BASE PRESS RELEASE. HAUT'S "DEATHBED" SEALED AFFIDAVIT HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED. IN IT HE CONFESSES TO SEEING THE SPACECRAFT AND BODIES IN BASE HANGAR 84/P-3 AND TELLS US THE MYSTERIOUS PRESS RELEASE WAS GENERAL RAMEY'S IDEA TO DIVERT PRESS AND PUBLIC ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE CLOSER AND MORE IMPORTANT CRAFT/BODY SITE.
SETT FREDERICK BENTHAL: ARMY PHOTOGRAPHER FLOWN IN FROM WASHINGTON D.C., SAID HE PHOTOGRAPHED ALIEN BODIES IN A TENT AT CRASH SITE AND SAW LARGE QUANTITIES OF CRASH DEBRIS BEING HAULED AWAY IN TRUCKS.


PFC ELIAS BENJAMIN: ROSWELL MP, SAID HE ESCORTED THE ALIEN BODIES FROM THE HEAVILY GUARDED BASE HANGAR P-3 TO THE BASE HOSPITAL, AND SAW A LIVE ONE BEING WORKED ON BY DOCTORS; WAS THREATENED AFTERWARDS IF HE DIDN'T KEEP QUIET.


1ST LT. CHESTER P. BARTON: A CRYPTO SPECIALIST AND ASSIGNED TO AN MP UNIT, BARTON SAID HE WAS ORDERED TO THE CRASH SITE 45 MINUTES NORTH OF TOWN TO CHECK ON THE CLEANUP, SAW A FOOTBALL-FIELD-SIZE BUM IMPACT AREA HEAVILY GUARDED BY MPS, SCATTERED METAL DEBRIS, WAS TOLD RADIATION WAS AT THE SITE, HEARD ARCHEOLOGISTS HAD FIRST DISCOVERED IT, AND ALSO HEARD BODIES WERE TAKEN TO BASE HOSPITAL AND THEN TO FORT WORTH. BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAW, HE KNEW THAT THE BALLOON EXPLANATION WAS RIDICULOUS AND THERE HAD BEEN A COVER-UP. HOWEVER, BARTON WAS UNUSUAL IN BEING A FLYING SAUCER CRASH SKEPTIC, INSTEAD THINKING THAT IT WAS MAYBE A B-29 CRASH AND NUCLEAR ACCIDENT.


BILL BRAZEL JR.: RANCHER MACK BRAZEL'S SON, BILL BRAZEL INDEPENDENTLY CORROBORATED MANY DETAILS OF MARCEL'S TESTIMONY, INCLUDING THE STRANGE DEBRIS, THE LARGE, ELONGATED DEBRIS FIELD, AND HIS FATHEFS STORY OF AN EXPLOSION IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIOLENT ELECTRICAL STORM.
LOUIS RICKETT: ONE OF THE REGULAR ARMY CIC AGENTS IN MARCEL'S OFFICE, RICKETT CONFIRMED THE ANOMALOUS QUALITY OF THE DEBRIS, A MAJOR CLEANUP OPERATION AT BRAZEL'S RANCH, HIGH SECRECY, AND BEING INVOLVED IN A SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE CRAFT. HE WAS ALSO TOLD BY OTHERS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE MAIN CRAFT. LIKE CHESTER BARTON, HE PLACED THE MAIN IMPACT SITE A 45 MINUTE DRIVE NORTH OF ROSWELL.

BRIG. GEN. ARTHUREXON: THOUGH NOT A DIRECT PARTICIPANT, EXON WAS STATIONED AT WRIGHT FIELD AT THE TIME, OVERFLEW THE AREA SOON AFTERWARDS, AND WAS LATER COMMANDING OFFICER OF WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB. EXON WHEN FIRST INTERVIEWED FLATLY STATED, "ROSWELL WAS THE RECOVERY OF A CRAFT FROM SPACE." AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF TWO MAIN CRASH SITES. EXON ALSO SAID HE HEARD THAT BODIES WERE RECOVERED AND CONFIRMED THE DEBRIS WAS HIGHLY ANOMALOUS BASED ON TESTING DONE BY LABS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON. EXON ADDED THAT HE WAS AWARE OF OTHER CRASH-RECOVERIES THAT OCCURRED WHILE HE WAS C/0 AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON.


STEVEN LOVEKIN (SERVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE ARMY SIGNAL CORP DURING EISENHOWER AND KENNEDY ADMINISTRATIONS, 1959-1961) ALTHOUGH LIKE EXON NOT A DIRECT PARTICIPANT, LOVEKIN SAID HE RECEIVED 1959 PENTAGON BRIEFINGS AND BEING SHOWN A METALLIC BEAM WITH SYMBOLS FROM A 1947 N.M. CRASH (PRESUMABLY ROSWELL) PLUS BEING TOLD OF EITHER 3 OR 5 ALIENS BEING RECOVERED, ONE INITIALLY ALIVE. HE ALSO SAID HE WAS SHOWN VERY COMPELLING PHOTOGRAPHIC AND RADAR EVIDENCE OF UFOS. HE ALSO TESTIFIED OF THE THREATS AGAINST MILITARY PERSONNEL GIVEN THIS INFORMATION IF THEY WERE TO PUBLICLY REVEAL IT. FINALLY, HE TOLD OF EISENHOWER'S CONCERN OVER LOSING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION WITH POWER FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS GIVEN ACCESS TO THE MATERIALS.


BRIG. GEN. THOMAS DUBOSE: GEN. RAMEY'S CHIEF OF STAFF IN 1947, DUBOSE HANDLED THE HIGH-LEVEL PHONE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ROSWELL, FORT WORTH, AND WASHINGTON. DUBOSE WENT ON RECORD MANY TIMES ABOUT THE HIGH SECRECY INVOLVED (INCLUDING THE MATTER GOING DIRECTLY TO THE WHITE HOUSE), RECEIVING DIRECT ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON TO INSTIGATE A COVER-UP, GEN. RAMEY'S WEATHER BALLOON COVER STORY, AND A HIGHLY SECRET SHIPMENT OF DEBRIS FROM ROSWELL TO FORT WORTH, WASHINGTON, AND WRIGHT FIELD. DUHOSE'S DAMNING TESTIMONY MADE HIM A COMPLETE NONENTITY IN THE AIR FORCE'S 1995 ROSWELL REPORT, WHICH DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO IDENTIFY HIM IN THE PHOTOS TAKEN OF GEN. RAMEY WITH HIS WEATHER BALLOON. (VISIT THE WEBSITE TO VIEW DUBOSE'S AIR FORCE BIOGRAPHY, HIS SWORN AFFIDAVIT, AND A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF HIS TESTIMONY WHICH THE AIR FORCE WAS SO EAGER TO AVOID.)


SGT ROBERT SLUSHERAND PFC LLOYD THOMPSON: CREW MEMBERS ON A MYSTERIOUS B-29 FLIGHT FROM ROSWELL TO FORT WORTH ON JULY 9, 1947, TRANSPORTING A LARGE WOODEN CRATE IN THE BOMB BAY SURROUNDED BY AN ARMED GUARD. UPON ARRIVAL, THE PLANE WAS MET BY HIGH BRASS AND A MORTICIAN. THIS IS PROBABLY THE FLIGHT REFERRED TO IN THE RAMEY MEMO THAT WOULD SHIP WHATEVER WAS "IN THE 'DISC'" TO FORT WORTH BY A B-29 SPECIAL TRANSPORT PLANE. NEW WITNESSES TO THE FLIGHT, INCLUDING DAUGHTER OF THE HEAD SECURITY GUARD, SAYING THAT ALIEN BODIES WERE INSIDE THE CRATE.

DENNIS ALSO CLAIMED TO BE AT THE ROSWELL BASE HOSPITAL, SEEING UNUSUAL DEBRIS IN THE BACK OF AN AMBULANCE INCLUDING A POD-LIKE OBJECT PERHAPS ALLUDED TO IN THE RAMEY MESSAGE, AND BEING THREATENED. HE ALSO CLAIMED TO KNOW A ROSWELL NURSE WHO ASSISTED IN A PRELIMINARY AUTOPSY AT THE BASE HOSPITAL AND WHO DESCRIBED THE ALIENS TO HIM.


THE NURSE SUBSEQUENTLY DISAPPEARED. HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY THE MYSTERY NURSE HAVE PROVEN TO BE A COMPLETE FAILURE AFTER DENNIS PROVIDED A FALSE NAME. HOWEVER, ALSO SEE SOME CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING DENNIS' AFFIDAVIT, SUCH AS DAVID WAGNON. A MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, WHO REMEMBERED THE NURSE FITTING DENNIS' DESCRIPTION, AS DID PETE ANAYA, WHO SAID THE PRETTY NURSE HE KNEW AND ENCOUNTERED AT THE BASE HANGAR TELLING HIM OF THE BODIES THERE SUBSEQUENTLY DISAPPEARED.


ROSWELL POLICE CHIEF L. M. HALL STATED THAT DENNIS WAS TELLING HIM OF CALLS FROM THE BASE ABOUT SMALL COFFINS FOR THE ALIENS ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE CRASHED SAUCER STORY BROKE IN THE ROSWELL PAPERS. SIMILARLY, S/SGT. MILTON SPROUSE ALSO SAID HE HEARD OF THE COFFIN CALL FROM DENNIS AND A MEDIC FRIEND TOLD HIM OF THE ALIEN BODIES AND AUTOPSY AT THE HOSPITAL.


THE MEDIC AND DOCTORS AND NURSES INVOLVED IN THE AUTOPSY ALL IMMEDIATELY WERE TRANSFERRED AND THEIR FATE REMAINED UNKNOWN. IN ADDITION, OTHER INDEPENDENT WITNESSES HAVE PROVIDED FIRST AND SECOND-HAND TESTIMONY ABOUT SMALL BODIES BEING FOUND WITH DETAILS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED BY DENNIS, INCLUDING WALTER HAUL FREDERICK BENTHAL. ELI BENJAMIN, AND RELATIVES OF "PAPPY" HENDERSON.
FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF OLIVER "PAPPY" HENDERSON: HENDERSON WAS ONE OF THE SENIOR PILOTS AT ROSWELL. WHEN THE FIRST PUBLIC STORIES OF A ROSWELL SAUCER CRASH BEGAN CIRCULATING IN 1981, HENDERSON CONFIDED TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF BEING THE PILOT WHO FLEW BODIES OF THE ALIENS AND CRASH WRECKAGE TO WRIGHT FIELD. HE ALSO CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE CRAFT AND BODIES, AND PROVIDED A DESCRIPTION OF THE ALIENS.


SGT ROBERT E. SMITH: A MEMBER OF AN AIR TRANSPORT UNIT AT ROSWELL, SMITH SAID HE HELPED LOAD CRATES FILLED WITH DEBRIS FOR TRANSPORT BY C-54'S, INCLUDING ONE FLOWN BY HENDERSON AND HIS CREW. SMITH WAS ALSO AMONG THE WITNESSES TO DESCRIBE THE MYSTERIOUS "MEMORY FOIL" WHICH HE SAID WAS IN THE CRATES. HE FURTHER DESCRIBED STRANGERS TO THE BASE DRESSED IN PLAINCLOTHES AND FLASHING ID CARDS FOR SOME UNKNOWN PROJECT, PERHAPS PART OF THE SPECIAL CIC-TEAM MENTIONED IN THE RAMEY MEMO AND BY FRANK KAUFMANN. FINALLY HE CLAIMED THAT DISTANT COUSIN OF HIS WAS WITH THE SECRET SERVICE AND WAS THERE AT THE BASE REPRESENTING PRESIDENT TRUMAN. (THE SAME NAME WAS ALSO PROVIDED BY KAUFMANN.)


S/SGT EARL V. FUFFORD: IN THE ENGINEERING SQUADRON, FULFORD SAID HE PARTICIPATED IN THE LARGE DEBRIS FIELD CLEANUP GUARDED BY MPS, HANDLED THE MYSTERIOUS "MEMORY FOIL," SAW WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE TRAPPED CRASH OBJECT ON A FLATBED TRUCK BEING TOWED TO HANGAR 84, AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WAS MADE TO LOAD A LARGE WOODEN CRATE INTO AN IDLING C-54.


EARL ZIMMERMAN: FORMERLY WITH AFOSI (AF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE). WHILE IN OFFICERS' CLUB HEARD MANY RUMORS ABOUT FLYING SAUCER CRASH AND OF IT BEING INVESTIGATED UNDER THE GUISE OF AN AIRPLANE CRASH. SEVERAL TIMES OBSERVED GEN. RAMEY AND CHARLES LINDBERGH BEING AT BASE UNANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS. LIKE ROBERT SMITH, SPOKE OF SEEING AN UNKNOWN CIC MAN BEING AT BASE. COL. BLANCHARD TOLD HIM IT WAS OK. LATER WORKED WITH ASTRONOMER DR. LINCOLN LAPAZ AND CORROBORATED STORY OF ROSWELL CIC MAN LEWIS RICKETT THAT LAPAZ INVESTIGATED ROSWELL AFTERWARDS WITH THE HELP OF THE CIC TO TRY TO DETERMINE OBJECTS TRAJECTORY. AGAIN AN AIRPLANE CRASH WAS THE COVER STORY.


LL ROBERT SHIRKEY: THEN THE ASSISTANT OPERATIONS OFFICER, SHIRKEY WITNESSED THE LOADING OF THE ROBERT PORTER, HE ALSO STATED THAT THE PLANE'S PILOT WAS DEPUTY COMMANDING OFFICER LT. COL. PAYNE JENNINGS, WHO WAS NOW THE ACTING C/0 WITH COL. BLANCHARD OFFICIALLY ON LEAVE. NINE DAYS LATER. SHIRKEY WAS ABRUPTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE PHILIPPINES TO A POST THAT DIDN'T EXIST. JENNINGS PERSONALLY FLEW HIM TO HIS NEXT ASSIGNMENT.


SQL ROBERT PORTER: WAS ON MARCEL'S FLIGHT TO FORT WORTH AND WAS HANDED WRAPPED PACKAGES OF DEBRIS SAMPLES. SAID THAT FLIGHT WAS PILOTED BY DEPUTY BASE COMMANDER JENNINGS. HE WAS TOLD ON BOARD THAT THE CRASH MATERIAL WAS FROM A FLYING SAUCER. LATER, THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A WEATHER BALLOON. SAID DEBRIS WAS LOADED ONTO ANOTHER PLANE.


ART MCQUIDDY: FORMER EDITOR OF THE ROSWELL MORNING DISPATCH. SAID BASE COMMANDER COL. BLANCHARD ADMITTED TO AUTHORIZING BASE PRESS RELEASE AND OF STRANGE MATERIAL BEING FOUND BY HIS MEN.


JUDD ROBERTS: CO-OWNER OF ROSWELL RADIO STATION KGFL OWNER.

LYDIA SLEPPY: ALBUQUERQUE TELETYPE OPERATOR AND ONE OF EARLIEST WITNESSES. STATED THAT THE STORY PHONED IN FROM FIELD BY ROSWELL RADIO REPORTER JOHNNY MCBOYLE ABOUT SEEING THE CRASHED SAUCER AND HEARING OF BODIES WAS INTERCEPTED AND CUT-OFF ON THE TELETYPE WIRE BY THE FBI.


LORETTA PROCTOR: NEIGHBOR OF RANCHER MACK BRAZEL. BRAZEL TOLD HER AND HER HUSBAND OF FINDING STRANGE MATERIAL BEFORE GOING TO ROSWELL, AND SHOWING THEM A WOOD-LIKE PIECE THAT COULDN'T BE CUT OR BURNED. THEY ADVISED HIM TO GO TO ROSWELL AND REPORT IT. BRAZEL WAS DETAINED AT THE BASE AND COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF HIS TREATMENT WHEN HE RETURNED.


SALLY STRICKLAND TADOLINI: ANOTHER NEIGHBOR OF BRAZEL'S. ALTHOUGH ONLY 9 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, REMEMBERED MACK BRAZEL'S GROWN SON BILL BRAZEL BRINGING OVER A PIECE OF METALLIC-LOOKING DEBRIS WITH MEMORY PROPERTIES TO SHOW TO HER FAMILY (INCIDENT CORROBORATED BY HER MOTHER). DESCRIBED IT AS TOUGH, RESEMBLED A SMOOTH 'FABRIC" LIKE SILK OR SATIN, AND, OF COURSE, UNFOLDED ITSELF TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE AFTER BEING CRUMPLED UP. INDEPENDENTLY CORROBORATED BILL BRAZEL'S STORY OF FINDING MATERIAL AND ALSO MARCEL'S OF A METALLIC FABRIC MATERIAL WITH MEMORY PROPERTIES WHICH HE COULD BLOW THROUGH (THEREFORE NOT BALLOON MATERIAL).

 

ALSO REMEMBERED THE ADULTS TALKING ABOUT MACK BRAZEL'S BAD TREATMENT AT HANDS OF MILITARY.

AMONG OTHER MATERIAL, HE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERS A SMALL METALLIC "I-BEAM" WITH PURPLISH "HIEROGLYPHICS."


"GENERAL ROGER M. RAMEY WAS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE ROSWELL INCIDENT, HUT INFORMATION ON HIM IS HARD TO COME BY. EVEN THOUGH HE BECAME A FAIRLY IMPORTANT AIR FORCE GENERAL IN THE EARLY 1950S, FOR SOME REASON THE AIR FORCE BIOGRAPHICAL WEB PAGE ON THEIR GENERALS DOESNT LIST HIM.
RAMEY WAS BORN IN 1903 IN SULPHUR SPRINGS, TEXAS, BUT GREW UP IN DENTON, TEXAS, ABOUT 40 MILES NORTH OF FORT WORTH. HE GRADUATED FROM NORTH TEXAS STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE IN DENTON AND WANTED TO STUDY MEDICINE. BUT HE WON A RODEO COMPETITION AND "PREFERRED WORKING ON A RANCH TO BOOKS."


HE WAS THE MESS SERGEANT IN A LOCAL NATIONAL GUARD UNIT, AND THE CAPTAIN INSISTED YOUNG "COWBOY" RAMEY TAKE THE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION FOR ENTRANCE TO THE U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY, WINNING THE WEST POINT APPOINTMENT. HE ENTERED WEST POINT IN 1924.


JULY 26,1946: RAMEY WROTE ROSWELL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF MAJOR JESSE MARCEL A COMMENDATION FOR HIS WORK DURING CROSSROADS, CITING HIS IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SECURITY, HIS HANDLING OF COMPLEX INTELLIGENCE MATTERS, AND THE PERFECTION OF HIS STAFF BRIEFINGS. A YEAR LATER MARCEL WAS TO HANDLE THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE STRANGE CRASH DEBRIS FOUND BY RANCHER MAC BRAZEL NEAR ROSWELL AND FLY THE DEBRIS TO FORT WORTH FOR EXAMINATION BY GEN. RAMEY.


JUNE 30, 1947: RAMEY AND HIS INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WERE GIVING PRESS INTERVIEWS AND DEBUNKING THE NEW FLYING SAUCER PHENOMENON.


JULY 6, 1947: RAMEY SPENT ALL DAY ATTENDING AN AIR SHOW IN HIS HOME TOWN OF DENTON, TX (AND PROBABLY VISITING RELATIVES). MEANWHILE, BACK IN FORT WORTH WITH RAMEY AWAY FROM THE BASE, HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, BRIG. GEN. THOMAS DUBOSE, SAID HE FIRST LEARNED OF THE FIND AT ROSWELL BY PHONE FROM SA C ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF GEN. MCMULLEN. ACCORDING TO DUBOSE, MCMULLEN ORDERED DEBRIS SAMPLES FLOWN IMMEDIATELY TO WASHINGTON BY "COLONEL COURIER, "FIRST STOPPING IN FORT WORTH. THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE STRICTEST SECRECY, SAID DUBOSE. MCMULLEN ORDERED HIM NOT TO TELL ANYONE, NOT EVEN RAMEY.


JULY 8, 1947: THE INFAMOUS ROSWELL BASE FLYING DISK PRESS RELEASE AND RAMEY'S SUBSEQUENT DEBUNKING OF IT AS A WEATHER BALLOON. ACCORDING TO DUBOSE, MCMULLEN ORDERED THE COVER-UP IN ANOTHER PHONE CALL TO DUBOSE FROM WASHINGTON. BOTH DUBOSE AND ROSWELL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF JESSE MARCEL SAID THE WEATHER BALLOON WAS NOT WHAT MARCEL BROUGHT FROM ROSWELL, BEING NOTHING BUT A COVER STORY TO GET RID OF THE PRESS.

"MOST OF THE TESTIMONY IN THIS (THE FOLLOWING) DOCUMENT IS FROM THE 1992 BOOK "CRASH AT CORONA" BY STANTON FRIEDMAN AND DON BERLINER, PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES BY PARAGON HOUSE. THAT BOOK CONTAINS LOTS OF OTHER INTERESTING MATERIAL, INCLUDING MATERIAL REGARDING ANOTHER CRASH SITE IN NEW MEXICO.


SEQUENCE OF EVENTS:

ON JULY 2, 1947, DURING THE EVENING, A FLYING SAUCER CRASHED ON THE FOSTER RANCH NEAR CORONA, NEW MEXICO. THE CRASH OCCURRED DURING A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM. (THE MILITARY BASE NEAREST THE CRASH SITE IS IN ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO; HENCE, ROSWELL IS MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT THAN CORONA, EVEN THOUGH CORONA IS CLOSER TO THE CRASH SITE.)
 

ON JULY 3, 1947, WILLIAM "MAC"BRAZEL (RHYMES WITH "FRAZZLE") AND HIS 7-YEAR-OLD NEIGHBOR DEE PROCTOR FOUND THE REMAINS OF THE CRASHED FLYING SAUCER. BRAZEL WAS FOREMAN OF THE FOSTER RANCH. THE PIECES WERE SPREAD OUT OVER A LARGE AREA, PERHAPS MORE THAN HALF A MILE LONG. WHEN BRAZEL DROVE DEE BACK HOME, HE SHOWED A PIECE OF THE WRECKAGE TO DEE'S PARENTS, FLOYD AND LORETTA PROCTOR. THEY ALL AGREED THE PIECE WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER SEEN.
 

ON JULY 6, 1947, BRAZEL SHOWED PIECES OF THE WRECKAGE TO CHAVES COUNTY SHERIFF GEORGE WILCOX. WILCOX CALLED ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD (AAF) AND TALKED TO MAJOR JESSE MARCEL, THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. MARCEL DROVE TO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND INSPECTED THE WRECKAGE. MARCEL REPORTED TO HIS COMMANDING OFFICER, COLONEL WILLIAM "BUTCH" BLANCHARD. BLANCHARD ORDERED MARCEL TO GET SOMEONE FROM THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS, AND TO PROCEED TO THE RANCH WITH BRAZEL, AND TO COLLECT AS MUCH OF THE WRECKAGE AS THEY COULD LOAD INTO THEIR TWO VEHICLES.
 

SOON AFTER THIS, MILITARY POLICE ARRIVED AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE, COLLECTED THE WRECKAGE BRAZEL HAD LEFT THERE, AND DELIVERED THE WRECKAGE TO BLANCHARD'S OFFICE. THE WRECKAGE WAS THEN FLOWN TO EIGHTH AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS IN FORT WORTH, AND FROM THERE TO WASHINGTON.
MEANWHILE, MARCEL AND SHERIDAN CAVITT OF THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS DROVE TO THE RANCH WITH MAC BRAZEL. THEY ARRIVED LATE IN THE EVENING. THEY SPENT THE NIGHT IN SLEEPING HAGS IN A SMALL OUT-BUILDING ON THE RANCH, AND IN THE MORNING PROCEEDED TO THE CRASH SITE.
 

ON JULY 7, 1947, MARCEL AND CAVITT COLLECTED WRECKAGE FROM THE CRASH SITE. AFTER FILLING CAVITT'S VEHICLE WITH WRECKAGE, MARCEL TOLD CAVITT TO GO ON AHEAD, THAT MARCEL WOULD COLLECT MORE WRECKAGE, AND THEY WOULD MEET LATER BACK AT ROSWELL AAF. MARCEL FILLED HIS VEHICLE
WITH WRECKAGE. ON THE WAY HACK TO THE AIR FIELD, MARCEL STOPPED AT HOME TO SHOW HIS WIFE AND SON THE STRANGE MATERIAL HE HAD FOUND.
 

ON JULY 7, 1947, AROUND 4:00 PM, LYDIA SLEPPY AT ROSWELL RADIO STATION KSWS BEGAN TRANSMITTING A STORY ON THE TELETYPE MACHINE REGARDING A CRASHED FLYING SAUCER OUT ON THE FOSTER RANCH. TRANSMISSION WAS INTERRUPTED, SEEMINGLY BY THE FBI.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, IN THE MORNING, MARCEL AND CAVITT AMVED BACK AT ROSWELL AAF WITH TWO CARLOADS OF WRECKAGE. MARCEL ACCOMPANIED THIS WRECKAGE, OR MOST IT, ON A FLIGHT TO FORT WORTH AAF.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, AROUND NOON, COLONEL BLANCHARD AT ROSWELL AAF ORDERED SECOND LIEUTENANT WALTER HAUT TO ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE TELLING THE COUNTRY THAT THE ARMY HAD FOUND THE REMAINS OF A CRASHED A FLYING SAUCER. HAUT WAS THE PUBLIC INFBRMATHN OFFICER FOR THE 509TH BOMB GROUP AT ROSWELL AAF. HAUT DELIVERED THE PRESS RELEASE TO FRANK JOYCE AT RADIO STATION KGFL. JOYCE WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR HAUT TO RETURN TO THE BASE, THEN CALLED HAUT THERE TO CONFINN THE STORY. JOYCE THEN SENT THE STORY ON THE WESTERN UNION WIRE TO THE UNITED PRESS BUREAU.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, IN THE AFTERNOON, GENERAL CLEMENCE MCMULLEN IN WASHINGTON SPOKE BY TELEPHONE WITH COLONEL (LATER BRIGADIER GENERAL) THOMAS DUBOSE IN FORT WORTH, CHIEF OF STAFF TO EIGHTH AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL ROGER RAMEY. MCMULLEN ORDERED DUBOSE TO TELL RAMEY TO QUASH THE FLYING SAUCER STORY BY CREATING A COVER STORY, AND TO SEND SOME OF THE CRASH MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY TO WASHINGTON.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, IN THE AFTERNOON, GENERAL ROGER RAMEY HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE AT EIGHTH AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS IN FORT WORTH IN WHICH HE ANNOUNCED THAT WHAT HAD CRASHED AT CORONA WAS A WEATHER BALLOON, NOT A FLYING SAUCER. TO MAKE THIS STORY CONVINCING, HE SHOWED THE PRESS THE REMAINS OF A DAMAGED WEATHER BALLOON THAT HE CLAIMED WAS THE ACTUAL WRECKAGE FROM THE CRASH SITE. (APPARENTLY, THE OBLIGING PRESS DID NOT ASK WHY THE ARMY HURRIEDLY TRANSPORTED WEATHER BALLOON WRECKAGE TO FORT WORTH, TEXAS, SITE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM THE CRASH SITE IN A REMOTE AREA OF NEW MEXICO.)

THE ONLY NEWSPAPERS THAT CARRIED THE INITIAL FLYING SAUCER VERSION OF THE STORY WERE EVENING PAPERS FROM THE MIDWEST TO THE WEST, INCLUDING THE CHICAGO DAILY NEWS, THE LOS ANGELES HERALD EXPRESS, THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER, AND THE ROSWELL DAILY RECORD. THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE WERE MORNING PAPERS AND SO CARRIED ONLY THE COVER-UP STORY THE NEXT MORNING.


AT SOME POINT, A LARGE GROUP OF SOLDIERS WERE SENT TO THE DEBRIS FIELD ON THE FOSTER RANCH, INCLUDING A LOT OF MPS WHOSE JOB WAS TO LIMIT ACCESS TO THE FIELD. A WIDE SEARCH WAS LAUNCHED WELL BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DEBRIS FIELD. WITHIN A DAY OR TWO, A FEW MILES FROM THE DEBRIS FIELD, THE MAIN BODY OF THE FLYING SAUCER WAS FOUND, AND A MILE OR TWO FROM THAT SEVERAL BODIES OF SMALL HUMANOIDS WERE FOUND.


THE MILITARY TOOK MAC BRAZEL INTO CUSTODY FOR ABOUT A WEEK, DURING WHICH TIME HE WAS SEEN ON THE STREETS OF ROSWELL WITH A MILITARY ESCORT. HIS BEHAVIOR AROUSED THE CURIOSITY OF FRIENDS WHEN HE PASSED THEM WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF RECOGNITION. FOLLOWING THIS PERIOD OF DETENTION, BRAZEL REPUDIATED HIS INITIAL STORY."

19"...I DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE PERSONNEL ON BOARD THE CRAFT HAD SURVIVED THE CRASH..."
THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM COPY OF THE SIGNED AFFIDAVIT SUBMITTED ON 8-7-1991 BY GLENN DENNIS, A MORTICIAN, IN ROSWELL, N.M. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT DESCRIBED IN THE LETTER FROM MRS. MACELROY:

(PLEASE NOTE: MRS. MACELROY IS NOT THE SAME NURSE THAT MR. DENNIS MENTIONS IN HIS AFFIDAVIT. ALTHOUGH NO OFFICIAL IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE, SEVERAL WITNESSES HAVE IDENTIFIED "NURSE X" AS 1ST LT. ADELINE "EILEEN" FANTON.)

"AFFIDAVIT OF GLENN DENNIS
(1) MY NAME IS GLENN DENNIS
 

(2) MY ADDRESS IS: XXXXXXXXXX
 

(3) I AM () EMPLOYED AS: () RETIRED,
 

(4) IN JULY 1947, I WAS A MORTICIAN, WORKING FOR THE BALLARD FUNERAL HOME IN ROSWELL, WHICH HAD A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE MORTUARY SERVICES FOR THE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD. ONE AFTERNOON, AROUND 1:15 OR 1:30,1 RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE BASE MORTUARY OFFICER WHO ASKED WHAT WAS THE SMALLEST SIZE HERMETICALLY SEALED CASKET THAT WE HAD IN STOCK. HE SAID, "WE NEED TO KNOW THIS IN CASE SOMETHING COMES UP IN THE FUTURE." HE ASKED HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET ONE, AND I ASSURED HIM I COULD GET ONE FOR HIM THE FOLLOWING DAY. HE SAID HE WOULD CALL BACK IF THEY NEEDED ONE.
 

(5) ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR LATER, HE CALLED BACK AND ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE THE PREPARATION FOR BODIES THAT HAD BEEN LYING OUT ON THE DESERT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. BEFORE I COULD ANSWER, HE SAID HE SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT EFFECT THE PREPARATION PROCEDURES WOULD HAVE ON THE BODY'S CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, BLOOD AND TISSUES. I EXPLAINED THAT OUR CHEMICALS WERE MAINLY STRONG SOLUTIONS OF FORMALDEHYDE AND WATER, AND THAT THE PROCEDURE WOULD PROBABLY ALTER THE BODY'S CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. I OFFERED TO COME OUT TO THE BASE TO ASSIST WITH ANY PROBLEM HE MIGHT HAVE, BUT HE REITERATED THAT THE INFOMIATION WAS FOR FUTURE USE. I SUGGESTED THAT IF HE HAD SUCH A SITUATION THAT I WOULD TRY TO FREEZE THE BODY IN DRY ICE FOR STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION.
 

(6) APPROXIMATELY A HOUR OR AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES LATER, I GOT A CALL TO TRANSPORT A SERVICEMAN WHO HAD A LACERATION ON HIS HEAD AND PERHAPS A FRACTURED NOSE. I GAVE HIM FIRST AID AND DROVE HIM OUT TO THE BASE. I GOT THERE AROUND 5:00 PM.
 

(7) ALTHOUGH I WAS A CIVILIAN, I USUALLY HAD FREE ACCESS ON THE BASE BECAUSE THEY KNEW ME.
I DROVE THE AMBULANCE AROUND TO THE BACK OF THE BASE INFIRMARY AND PARKED IT NEXT TO ANOTHER AMBULANCE. THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND INSIDE I SAW SOME WRECKAGE. THERE WERE SEVERAL PIECES WHICH LOOKED LIKE THE BOTTOM OF A CANOE, ABOUT THREE FEET IN LENGTH. IT RESEMBLED STAINLESS STEEL WITH A PURPLE HUE, AS IF IT HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE. THERE WAS SOME STRANGE-LOOKING WRITING ON THE MATERIAL RESEMBLING EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS. ALSO THERE WERE TWO MPS PRESENT.
 

(8) I CHECKED THE AIRMAN IN AND WENT TO THE STAFF LOUNGE TO HAVE A COKE. I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR A NURSE, A 2ND LIEUTENANT, WHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED ABOUT THREE MONTHS EARLIER RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE. SHE WAS 23 YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME (I WAS 22). I SAW HER COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE EXAMINING ROOMS WITH A CLOTH OVER HER MOUTH. SHE SAID, "MY GOSH, GET OUT OF HERE OR YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE." SHE WENT INTO ANOTHER DOOR WHERE A CAPTAIN STOOD. HE ASKED ME WHO I WAS AND WHAT I WAS DOING HERE. I TOLD HIM, AND HE INSTRUCTED ME TO STAY THERE. I SAID, "IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A CRASH; WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GET READY?" HE TOLD ME TO STAY RIGHT THERE. THEN TWO MPS CAME UP AND BEGAN TO ESCORT ME OUT OF THE INFIRMARY. THEY SAID THEY HAD ORDERS TO FOLLOW ME OUT TO THE FUNERAL HOME.
 

(9) WE GOT ABOUT 10 OR 15 FEET WHEN I HEARD A VOICE SAY, "WE'RE NOT THROUGH WITH THAT SOB.
BRING HIM BACK." THERE WAS ANOTHER CAPTAIN, A REDHEAD WITH THE MEANEST-LOOKING EYES I HAD EVER SEEN, WHO SAID, "YOU DID NOT SEE ANYTHING, THERE WAS NO CRASH HERE, AND IF YOU SAY ANYTHING YOU COULD GET INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE." I SAID, "HEY LOOK MISTER, I'M A CIVILIAN AND YOU CAN'T DO A DAMN THING TO ME." HE SAID, "YES WE CAN; SOMEBODY WILL BE PICKING YOUR BONES OUT OF THE SAND." THERE WAS A BLACK SERGEANT WITH A PAD IN HIS HAND WHO SAID, "HE WOULD MAKE GOOD DOG FOOD FOR OUR DOGS." THE CAPTAIN SAID, "GET THE SOB OUT." THE MPS FOLLOWED ME BACK TO THE FUNERAL HOME.
 

(10) THE NEXT DAY, I TRIED TO CALL THE NURSE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. ABOUT 11:00 AM, SHE CALLED THE FUNERAL HOME AND SAID, "I NEED TO TALK TO YOU." WE AGREED TO MEET AT THE OFFICERS CLUB. SHE WAS VERY UPSET. SHE SAID, "BEFORE I TALK TO YOU, YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A SACRED OATH THAT YOU WILL NEVER MENTION MY NAME, BECAUSE I COULD GET INTO A TOR OF TROUBLE." I AGREED.
 

(11) SHE SAID SHE HAD GONE TO GET SUPPLIES IN A ROOM WHERE TWO DOCTORS WERE PERFORMING A PRELIMARY AUTOPSY. THE DOCTORS SAID THEY NEEDED HER TO TAKE NOTES DURING THE PROCEDURE. SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER SMELLED ANYTHING SO HORRIBLE IN HER LIFE, AND THE SIGHT WAS THE MOST GRUESOME SHE HAD EVER SEEN. SHE SAID, "THIS WAS SOMETHING NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN." AS SHE SPOKE, I WAS CONCERNED THAT SHE MIGHT GO INTO SHOCK.
 

(12) SHE DREW ME A DIAGRAM OF THE BODIES, INCLUDING AN ARM WITH A HAND THAT HAD ONLY FOUR FINGERS; THE DOCTORS NOTED THAT ON THE END OF THE FINGERS WERE LITTLE PADS RESEMBLING SUCTION CUPS. SHE SAID THE HEAD WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE FOR THE BODY; THE EYES WERE DEEPLY SET; THE SKULLS WERE FLEXIBLE; THE NOSE WAS CONCAVE WITH ONLY TWO ORIFICES; THE MOUTH WAS A FINE SLIT, AND THE DOCTORS SAID THERE WAS HEAVY CARTILAGE INSTEAD OF TEETH. THE EARS WERE ONLY SMALL ORIFICES WITH FLAPS. THEY HAD NO HAIR, AND THE SKIN WAS BLACK-PE&IAPS DUE TO EXPOSURE IN THE SUN. SHE GAVE ME THE DRAWINGS.
 

(13) THERE WERE THREE BODIES; TWO WERE VERY MANGLED AND DISMEMBERED, AS IF DESTROYED BY PREDATORS; ONE WAS FAIRLY INTACT. THEY WERE THREE-AND-A-HALF TO FOUR FEET TALL. SHE TOLD ME THE DOCTORS SAID: "THIS ISN'T ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEE BEFORE; THERE'S NOTHING IN THE MEDICAL TEXTBOOKS LIKE THIS." SHE SAID SHE AND THE DOCTORS BECAME ILL. THEY HAD TO TURN OFF THE AIR CONDITIONING AND WERE AFRAID THE SMELL WOULD GO THROUGH THE HOSPITAL. THEY HAD TO MOVE THE OPERATION TO AN AIRPLANE HANGAR.
 

(14) I DROVE HER BACK TO THE OFFICERS' BARRACKS. THE NEXT DAY I CALLED THE HOSPITAL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS, AND THEY SAID SHE WASN'T AVAILABLE. I TRIED TO GET HER FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AND FINALLY GOT ONE OF THE NURSES WHO SAID THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN TRANSFENED OUT WITH SOME OTHER PERSONNEL. ABOUT 10 DAYS TO TWO WEEKS LATER, I GOT A LETTER FROM HER WITH AN APO NUMBER. SHE INDICATED WE COULD DISCUSS THE INCIDENT BY LETTER IN THE FUTURE. I WROTE BACK TO HER AND ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER THE LETTER CAME BACK MARKED "RETURN TO SENDER-DECEASED." LATER ONE OF THE NURSES AT THE BASE SAID THE RUMOR WAS THAT SHE AND FIVE OTHER NURSES HAD BEEN ON A TRAINING MISSION AND HAD BEEN KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH.
 

(15) SHERIFF GEORGE WILCOX AND MY FATHER WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS. THE SHERIFF WENT TO MY FOLKS' HOUSE THE MORNING AFTER THE EVENTS AT THE BASE AND SAID TO MY FATHER, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE GLENN'S IN, BUT YOU TELL YOUR SON THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING AND
HASN'T SEEN ANYTHING AT THE BASE." HE ADDED, "THEY WANT YOU AND YOUR WIFE'S NAME, AND THEY WANT YOUR AND YOUR CHILDREN'S ADDRESSES." MY FATHER IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO THE FUNERAL HOME AND ASKED ME WHAT KIND OF
TROUBLE I WAS IN. HE RELATED THE CONVERSATION WITH SHERIFF WILCOX, AND SO I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY. HE IS THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM I HAVE TOLD THIS STORY UNTIL RECENTLY.
 

(16) I HAD FILED AWAY THE SKETCHES THE NURSE GAVE ME THAT DAY. RECENTLY, AT THE REQUEST OF A RESEARCHER, I TRIED TO LOCATE MY PERSONAL FILES AT THE FUNERAL HOME, BUT THEY HAD ALL BEEN DESTROYED.
 

(17) I HAVE NOT BEEN PAID OR GIVEN ANYTHING OF VALUE TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT, WHICH IS THE TRUTH TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION.

20 "...TELEPATHIC THOUGHT..."
"TELEPATHY, FROM THE GREEK TEAE, TELE MEANING "REMOTE" AND ΠΆΘΕΙΑ, PATHEIA MEANING "TO BE AFFECTED BY", DESCRIBES THE PURPORTED TRANSFER OF INFORMATION ON THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BY MEANS OTHER THAN THE FIVE CLASSICAL SENSES. THE TERM WAS COINED IN 1882 BY THE CLASSICAL SCHOLAR FREDRIC W. H. MYERS, A FOUNDER OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH, SPECIFICALLY TO REPLACE THE EARLIER EXPRESSION THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE. A PERSON WHO IS ABLE TO MAKE USE OF TELEPATHY IS SAID TO BE ABLE TO READ THE MINDS OF OTHERS. TELEPATHY, ALONG WITH PSYCHOKINESIS FORMS THE MAIN BRANCHES OF PARAPSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AND MANY STUDIES SEEKING TO DETECT AND UNDERSTAND TELEPATHY HAVE BEEN DONE WITHIN THE FIELD.


TELEPATHY IS A COMMON THEME IN FICTION AND SCIENCE FICTION, WITH MANY SUPERHEROES AND SUPERVILLAINS HAVING TELEPATHIC ABILITIES. SUCH ABILITIES INCLUDE BOTH SENSING THE THOUGHTS OF OTHERS, AND CONTROLLING THE MINDS OF OTHER PEOPLE. TRANSHUMANISTS BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGICALLY ENABLED TELEPATHY, CALLED "TECHLEPATHY", WILL BE THE INEVITABLE FUTURE OF HUMANITY, AND SEEK TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL, SAFE DEVICES FOR DIRECTLY CONNECTING HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEMS."

21 "...I WAS THE ONLY WOMEN AT THE SITE..."
"ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE ALIEN BODIES AND A VANISHING NURSE CAME FROM PETE AND RUBEN ANAYA, WHO SAID THEY PICKED UP N.M. LT. GOVERNOR JOSEPH MONTOYA OUTSIDE THE LARGE BASE HANGAR. BESIDES THE HANGAR BEING HEAVILY GUARDED BY MPS, THEY SAID THERE WAS A BASE NURSE (OR MAYBE TWO DIFFERENT NURSES) WHO CAME OUTSIDE THE HANGAR AND SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH THEM. RUBEN SAID SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE BODIES WERE "NOT FROM THIS WORLD" AND THEN NOTICED ONE OF THEM MOVING. RUBEN SAID HE THEN WENT TO TAKE A LOOK AND ALSO GLIMPSED TWO SMALL BODIES FROM A DISTANCE UNDER SHEETS INSIDE THE HANGAR AND ONE OF THEM MOVING. HE DESCRIBED THE NURSE HE SPOKE TO AS BLONDISH AND HEAVYSET. [NOTE: OF THE FIVE NURSES THAT ARE PICTURED IN THE BASE YEARBOOK FROM AROUND JUNE/JULY 1947, NONE OF THEM APPEAR BLONDISH OR HEAVYSET, THOUGH.

IN CONTRAST, PETE ANAYA SAID HE KNEW THE NURSE HE SPOKE TO FROM THE OFFICER'S CLUB (HIS BROTHER RUBEN WORKED THERE AS A COOK), HAD DANCED WITH HER ONCE THE PREVIOUS HALLOWEEN AT A PARTY, SAID SHE RESEMBLED HIS WIFE MARY, AND WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WITH BEAUTIFUL HAIR. HE WANTED TO GO INSIDE THE HANGAR TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND SHE TOLD HIM HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING. AFTER THAT, HE SAID HE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN. (SOURCE: TIM SHAWCROSS, THE ROSWELL FILE, 1997)


FORMER ROSWELL POLICE CHIEF LM. HAFT REMEMBERED DENNIS TELLING HIM ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE NEWSPAPER STORIES OF THE CRASHED FLYING SAUCER, ABOUT STRANGE CALLS FROM THE BASE FOR CHILD-SIZE CASKETS "TO SHIP OR BURY THOSE ALIENS."


ANOTHER WITNESS THAT RECENTLY CAME FORTH TO CORROBORATE PARTS OF DENNIS' STORY WAS S/SQT. MILTON SPROUSE. THEN A B-29 CREW CHIEF WITH THE 830TH BOMB SQUADRON. SPROUSE SAID HE SPOKE TO DENNIS SEVERAL YEARS LATER WHILE DENNIS HANDLED A FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND. DENNIS TOLD HIM HE HAD RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE BASE FOR FIVE CHILDREN'S CASKETS FOR A CRASH THAT HAD HAPPENED 2 OR 3 DAYS BEFORE. THUS IT SEEMS THAT DENNIS' STORY OF THE CHILD CASKET CALL IS NOT OF RECENT ORIGIN HUT DATES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL EVENT ITSELF.


SPROUSE SAID THE BODIES WERE TAKEN TO A HANGAR HEAVILY GUARDED BY MPS WITH MACHINE GUNS. HE ALSO SAID HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THE AUTOPSY INITIALLY DESCRIBED BY DENNIS. A FELLOW STAFF SERGEANT IN HIS BARRACKS, WHO WORKED AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM MEDIC AT THE BASE HOSPITAL, WAS CALLED OUT THERE. WHEN HE CAME BACK HE RELATED THAT AN AUTOPSY ON ONE OR TWO OF THE "HUMANOID BODIES" HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TWO DOCTORS AND TWO NURSES. HIS FRIEND SAID HE HAD SEEN THE BODIES. SIMILAR TO DENNIS' NURSE, THE SERGEANT WAS TRANSFERRED THE FOLLOWING DAY AND NOBODY EVER FOUND OUT WHAT BECAME OF HIM.


SPROUSE ALSO HEARD THAT THE DOCTORS AND NURSES INVOLVED WITH THE AUTOPSY WERE ALSO TRANSFERRED AND NOBODY FOUND OUT WHAT BECAME OF THEM EITHER. FIVE MEMBERS OF HIS GROUND CREW WERE ALSO SENT TO THE RANCH TO HELP CLEAN UP THE DEBRIS FIELD. THEY TOLD HIM THE MATERIAL WAS "OUT OF THIS WORLD," INCLUDING FOIL THAT WHEN CRUMPLED RETURNED TO IFS ORIGINAL SHAPE."

SOME MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE BOOK MAY HAVE SIMILARITIES TO EARTH PHILOSOPHIES AS THE VARIETY OF THESE ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO LIST, AND BEAR TOO MANY FUNDAMENTAL SIMILARITIES TO BE EASILY DIFFERENTIATED. ALTHOUGH THE BOOK DISCUSSES THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE, THE TIME TRACK OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, PARANORMAL ACTIVITIES OF IMMORTAL AND/OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS, "ALIENS" OR "GODS", IT IS IN NO WAY THE INTENTION OF THE EDITOR TO REPRESENT, ENDORSE, FORWARD OR ASSUME THE VIEWPOINT OF THE AUTHOR, ANY POLITICAL DOCTRINE, ECONOMIC VESTED INTEREST, SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS, RELIGIOUS PRACTICE OR PHILOSOPHY, WHETHER TERRESTRIAL OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL.

DEDICATION

THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO ALL IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS, WHETHER THEY ARE AWARE OF THEMSELVES AS SUCH, OR NOT. IT IS ESPECIALLY DEDICATED TO THE WISDOM, COURAGE AND INTEGRITY OF THOSE GREATER BEINGS, WHO IN VARIOUS INCARNATIONS AT VARIOUS TIMES DURING THE PAST, IN THE PRESENT AND INTO THE FUTURE, ENKINDLE AND CARRY THE FLAME OF TRUTH INTO THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE UNIVERSE.


THIS DEDICATION IS NOT ONLY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL TEACHINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THESE BEINGS, BUT TO THE DEMONSTRATED AND DOCUMENTED COURAGE TO APPLY THEIR PHILOSOPHY IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING IGNORANCE, OVERT HOSTILITY AND AGGRESSIVE SUPPRESSION BY LESSER BEINGS AND BY THE SELF-SERVING VESTED INTERESTS OF INTER-GALACTIC AND PLANETARY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.


THOUGH RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER, THE PROFOUND WISDOM AND HEROIC DEDICATION OF SUCH BEINGS, AND THOSE WHO SHARE THEIR QUEST, HAVE BEEN THE ONLY EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO SPIRITUAL SLAVERY. FREEDOM, COMMUNICATION, CREATIVITY ,TRUST AND TRUTH FOR ALL IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS IN THIS UNIVERSE IS THEIR LEGACY. THE GOOD EXAMPLES SET BY THEM IS OUR SANCTUARY AND SUSTENANCE.

 

PERSONAL, DILIGENT APPLICATION OF THEIR TEACHINGS IS OUR WEAPON AGAINST THE DWINDLING SPIRAL OF CHAOS AND OBLIVION THAT IS THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE.

EDITORIAL GUIDELINES USED IN THIS BOOK

I HAVE TRIED NOT TO EDIT THE MATERIAL I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY EXCEPT TO THE DEGREE NECESSARY TO MAKE A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF THE MATERIAL SHE MAILED TO ME. WHEREVER POSSIBLE I HAVE QUOTED OR TRANSCRIBED HER ORIGINAL WRITTEN NOTES VERBATIM.


IN SOME INSTANCES I HAVE TAKEN EDITORIAL LIBERTY TO ADD OTHER INFORMATION, OR SUPPLEMENTARY COMMENTARY WHICH I FEEL WILL ADD USEFUL DEFINITIONS, OR CLARIFICATION TO THE INFORMATION GIVEN IN THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS, OR TO HER REMARKS OR OBSERVATIONS. THESE APPEAR AS A NUMBERED "(FOOTNOTE)" IN THE APPENDIX AT THE END OF THE BOOK. ALL FOOTNOTE REFERENCES, WHERE POSSIBLE, ARE COPIED VERBATIM FROM THE FREE INTERNET ENCYCLOPEDIA WEBSITE WWW.WIKIPEDIA.ORG.

 

IF INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH WIKIPEDIA.ORG, I USED THE POPULAR INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE WWW.GOOGLE.COM TO FIND A WEBSITE REFERENCE THAT SEEMED MOST APPROPRIATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER.


MRS. MACELROY DID NOT MAKE A NOTATION OF DATES IN THE MOST OF THE DOCUMENTS, SO I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT THE SEQUENCE OF MATERIAL MATCHES THE ACTUAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, OR SEQUENCE OF THE INTERVIEWS, EXCEPT AS NOTED ON THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS THEMSELVES.


SINCE IT HAS BEEN 60 YEARS SINCE THE DATE OF THE INTERVIEWS, AND CONSIDERING THE AGE OF MRS. MACELROY BEFORE HER DEATH, I REASONED THAT SHE DID NOT NECESSARILY HAVE AN ACUTE RECOLLECTION OF EXACT NAMES, DATES AND TIMES, EXCEPT AS RECORDED IN THE TRANSCRIPTS OF JULY 8TH THROUGH AUGUST 12TH, 1947.


THE MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED INTO THREE DIFFERENT TYPES. THE FOLLOWING NOTATIONS WILL BE USED TO DESIGNATE WHERE THESE APPEAR IN THIS BOOK:

INTRODUCTION - THE MYSTERY OF UFOS AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS

IF YOU HAVE STUDIED UFO PHENOMENA AT ALL, YOU ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE INFAMOUS ORSON WELLES RADIO BROADCAST OF "WAR OF THE WORLDS, AND THE INVASION FROM MARS" 1 (FOOTNOTE) ON OCT. 30, 1938. THIS FICTITIOUS RADIO DRAMATIZATION OF AN INVASION OF EARTH BY "ALIENS" INCITED A GLOBAL UFO AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL HYSTERIA LONG BEFORE THE UFO CRASH NEAR ROSWELL, N.M. IN 1947.


DURING THE PAST 60 YEARS, SINCE THE ALLEGED ROSWELL CRASH, THERE HAVE BEEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF REPORTED UFO SIGHTINGS. A GLOBAL HYSTERIA HAS EMERGED FROM "EVIDENCE" OF WHAT IS PRESUMED TO BE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENON. CONCURRENTLY, THE UNRELENTING DENIAL OF THIS PHENOMENON BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS PRECIPITATED AN UNINTERRUPTED FLURRY OF ACCUSATIONS, COUNTER-ACCUSATIONS, COVER-UP CONSPIRACY THEORIES, LUNATIC FRINGE SPECULATIONS, "SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS", ETC., ETC., AD NAUSEAM, AND A GROWING MULTITUDE OF SIMILAR ALLEGED "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS".


MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN I RECEIVED THE PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS FROM MRS. MACELROY WAS:

"THIS IS JUST ANOTHER SET OF MAJESTIC-12 DOCUMENTS". 2 (FOOTNOTE)

I AM REFERRING TO A "MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE" REPORTEDLY RECEIVED BY MAIL IN 1984 SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE LAST SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE SO-CALLED "MAJESTIC-12" COMMITTEE, ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED BY PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN SHORTLY AFTER THE ROSWELL INCIDENT IN 1947.


THERE ARE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES TO THE "MAJESTIC-12" DOCUMENTS AND THE PACKAGE I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY. IN THE CASE OF THE FORMER, AN ENVELOPE WAS SENT FROM AN ANONYMOUS SENDER WITH NO RETURN ADDRESS. IT CONTAINED AN UNDEVELOPED ROLL OF FILM. THAT'S ALL.

 

ON THE ROLL OF FILM WERE PHOTOS OF DOCUMENTS THAT WERE ASSUMED TO BE AUTHENTIC BY THE RECIPIENT AND HIS COLLEAGUES WHOSE VESTED INTEREST, I.E. LIVELIHOOD, DEPEND HEAVILY ON ATTRACTING PUBLIC NOTICE AND CREDIBILITY TO THEMSELVES AS "LEADING AUTHORITIES" ON THE SUBJECT OF UFO PHENOMENA. THEY HAVE WORKED RELENTLESSLY SINCE THEN TO DISCOVER "PROOF" THAT THE DOCUMENTS ARE AUTHENTIC. OF COURSE, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DENY EVERYTHING ALLEGED IN THE DOCUMENTS AND ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN GENERAL.


IN ADDITION, THE SUBJECT HAS BECOME SO THOROUGHLY OVERWHELMED WITH OBVIOUS FALSE REPORTS, DISCREDITED SOURCES, HEARSAY, MANUFACTURED FALSEHOODS, MISUNDERSTANDINGS, MISSING INFORMATION, ADDED INAPPLICABLE INFORMATION AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER CONFLICTING COMPLEXITIES WHICH HAVE MADE THE SUBJECT LAUGHABLE OR UNAPPROACHABLE AS A SCIENCE. THIS MAY BE INTENTIONAL, OR SIMPLY A REFLECTION OF THE GENERAL CHAOS AND BARBARISM THAT IS HUMANITY.


AS FOR GOVERNMENT DENIALS AND COVER-UPS, THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, HAVE MADE IT ABUNDANTLY APPARENT TO ME THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS DESTROYED ANY VESTIGE OF TRUST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD MAY HAVE HARBORED, EVEN THROUGH THE VIETNAM WAR, WATERGATE, AND MANY SIMILAR BETRAYALS, IN THE "HONESTY" OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, BY BLATANTLY LYING TO IT'S OWN PEOPLE ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.
 

IN SPITE OF VAST NUMBERS OF "UFO SIGHTINGS", INNUMERABLE REPORTS OF "ALIEN ABDUCTIONS", AND "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS" WITH EXTRATERRESTRIALS THAT PERVADE NEARLY ALL OF PREHISTORIC AND RECORDED HUMAN HISTORY I FOUND ONLY ONE UNDERLYING, UNIFYING, UNDISPUTABLE, AXIOMATIC COMMON DENOMINATOR THAT PERMEATES ALL OF THIS DATA:
ASSUMING THAT SUBJECTIVE REALITY, OR BELIEFS, OF INDIVIDUALS IS ACCEPTABLE EVIDENCE, THERE HAS BEEN NO UNIVERSALLY AGREED UPON "PROOF" THAT UFOS AND / OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FORMS EXIST WHETHER BASED ON GOVERNMENT ADMISSION , PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, CIRCUMSTANTIAL OR SUBJECTIVE DATA.


THERE ARE SEVERAL DEDUCTIONS I CAN INFER FROM THE LACK OF AGREEMENT, GOVERNMENT ADMISSION OR PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUCH THINGS ARE REAL THAT, IF VERIFIED, MAY LEAD TO A WORKABLE SOLUTION TO THIS MYSTERY:

DEDUCTION:
IN SPITE OF AN ENORMOUS COLLECTION OF SUBJECTIVE, CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND OBJECTIVE "EVIDENCE" OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ACTIVITY ON AND AROUND EARTH, THE EXISTENCE, INTENTIONS AND THE ACTIVITIES OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS REMAIN HIDDEN AND MYSTERIOUS.

DEDUCTION:
UNIVERSALLY AGREED UPON PROOF OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE BASED ON SUBJECTIVE DATA, GOVERNMENT ADMISSION, PHYSICAL AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ARE SUBJECT TO CONFLICTING VESTED INTERESTS, WHICH HAS MADE SUCH PROOF UNATTAINABLE.

COLLECTIVELY, THESE DEDUCTIONS BEG THE OBVIOUS QUESTION: IF EXTRATERRESTRIALS LIFE FORMS EXIST, WHY IS THERE NO CONSISTENT, FORTHRIGHT, OPEN, INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MANKIND AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS?


FORTUNATELY, SUBJECTIVE REALITY DOES NOT REQUIRE EVIDENCE OR "PROOF". THEREFORE, I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS BOOK IN ORDER TO PASS ALONG A SUBJECTIVE COMMUNICATION I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN IT.


PERSONALLY, I AM NOT ASSUMING THAT ANYTHING I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY IS IN ANY WAY AUTHENTIC, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ENVELOPE AND THE PAPER INSIDE THE ENVELOPE. I CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE ANY OF IT. INDEED, I CAN'T TRULY VERIFY THAT THERE WAS EVER SUCH A PERSON AS MRS. MACELROY OTHER THAN A VOICE I HEARD OVER THE PHONE IN 1998. THE VOICE COULD HAVE BEEN ANYONE.

 

PERSONALLY, I DO NOT HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN UFO RESEARCH. YES, I'VE WRITTEN A FEW BOOKS ABOUT IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS - BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT. BUT I HAVEN'T SOLD ENOUGH OF THOSE BOOKS TO PAY FOR THE TIME IT TOOK TO WRITE THEM. IT IS A HOBBY. I EARN MY LIVING AS A SMALL BUSINESS CONSULTANT.


IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO JUSTIFY, EXPLAIN, OR REMEDY ANY DISABILITY TO PERCEIVE OR UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERIES OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL EXISTENCE, UFOS, GOVERNMENTS AGENDAS OR SPIRITUAL ABILITIES. NOR IS IT INTENDED TO EDUCATE, PERSUADE, OR PROMOTE TO ANYONE THAT ANY OF THESE PHENOMENA EXIST. FURTHERMORE, WHAT I MAY OR MAY NOT THINK ABOUT ANY OF THIS IS IRRELEVANT.


MOREOVER, I HAVE BURNED ALL OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THE ENVELOPE I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY. I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE BEING HOUNDED BY UFO RESEARCHERS, GOVERNMENT AGENTS, GROCERY STORE TABLOIDS REPORTERS, UFO ADVOCATES AND DE-BUNKERS ALIKE, OR ANYONE ELSE. ANY "PROOFS" OR ATTEMPTS TO AUTHENTICATE THE ASSERTION THAT MRS. MACELROY ACTUALLY INTERVIEWED AN ALIEN IN 1947 WILL HAVE TO BE DONE BY OTHERS.

.1..."WAR OF THE WORLDS, AND THE INVASION FROM MARS"..."


"... THE DAY BEFORE HALLOWEEN, ON OCT. 30, 1938, WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TUNED IN TO A POPULAR RADIO PROGRAM THAT FEATURED PLAYS DIRECTED BY, AND OFTEN STARRING, ORSON WELLES. THE PERFORMANCE THAT EVENING WAS AN ADAPTATION OF THE SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, ABOUT A MARTIAN INVASION OF THE EARTH. BUT IN ADAPTING THE BOOK FOR A RADIO PLAY, WELLES MADE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE: UNDER HIS DIRECTION THE PLAY WAS WRITTEN AND PERFORMED SO IT WOULD SOUND LIKE A NEWS BROADCAST ABOUT AN INVASION FROM MARS, A TECHNIQUE THAT, PRESUMABLY, WAS INTENDED TO HEIGHTEN THE DRAMATIC EFFECT.


AS THE PLAY UNFOLDED, DANCE MUSIC WAS INTERRUPTED A NUMBER OF TIMES BY FAKE NEWS BULLETINS REPORTING THAT A "HUGE FLAMING OBJECT" HAD DROPPED ON A FARM NEAR GROVERS MILL, NEW JERSEY. AS MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE SAT ON THE EDGE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE SEAT, ACTORS PLAYING NEWS ANNOUNCERS, OFFICIALS AND OTHER ROLES ONE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR IN A NEWS REPORT, DESCRIBED THE LANDING OF AN INVASION FORCE FROM MARS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THE BROADCAST ALSO CONTAINED A NUMBER OF EXPLANATIONS THAT IT WAS ALL A RADIO PLAY, BUT IF MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE MISSED A BRIEF EXPLANATION AT THE BEGINNING, THE NEXT ONE DIDN'T ARRIVE UNTIL 40 MINUTES INTO THE PROGRAM.


AT ONE POINT IN THE BROADCAST, AN ACTOR IN A STUDIO, PLAYING A NEWSCASTER IN THE FIELD, DESCRIBED THE EMERGENCE OF ONE OF THE ALIENS FROM ITS SPACECRAFT. "GOOD HEAVENS, SOMETHING'S WRIGGLING OUT OF THE SHADOW LIKE A GRAY SNAKE," HE SAID, IN AN APPROPRIATELY DRAMATIC TONE OF VOICE. "NOW IT'S ANOTHER ONE, AND ANOTHER. THEY LOOK LIKE TENTACLES TO ME. THERE, I CAN SEE THE THING'S BODY. IT'S LARGE AS A BEAR AND IT GLISTENS LIKE WET LEATHER. BUT THAT FACE. IT...IT'S INDESCRIBABLE. I CAN HARDLY FORCE MYSELF TO KEEP LOOKING AT IT. THE EYES ARE BLACK AND GLEAM LIKE A SERPENT. THE MOUTH IS V-SHAPED WITH SALIVA DRIPPING FROM ITS RIMLESS LIPS THAT SEEM TO QUIVER AND PULSATE....THE THING IS RAISING UP. THE CROWD FALLS BACK. THEY'VE SEEN ENOUGH. THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE. I CAN'T FIND WORDS. I'M PULLING THIS MICROPHONE WITH ME AS I TALK. I'LL HAVE TO STOP THE DESCRIPTION UNTIL I'VE TAKEN A NEW POSITION. HOLD ON, WILL YOU PLEASE, I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE."


AS IT LISTENED TO THIS SIMULATION OF A NEWS BROADCAST THE AUDIENCE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS HEARING AN ACTUAL NEWS ACCOUNT OF AN INVASION FROM MARS. PEOPLE PACKED THE ROADS, HID IN CELLARS, LOADED GUNS, EVEN WRAPPED THEIR HEADS IN WET TOWELS AS PROTECTION FROM MARTIAN POISON GAS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST ALIENS, OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ACTING OUT THE ROLE OF THE PANIC-STRICKEN PUBLIC THAT ACTUALLY BELONGED IN A RADIO PLAY.


NEWS OF THE PANIC (WHICH WAS CONVEYED VIA GENUINE NEWS REPORTS) QUICKLY GENERATED A NATIONAL SCANDAL. THERE WERE CALLS, WHICH NEVER WENT ANYWHERE, FOR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS OF BROADCASTING TO ENSURE THAT A SIMILAR INCIDENT WOULDN T HAPPEN AGAIN.
IN A PRESCIENT COLUMN, IN THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE, DOROTHY THOMPSON FORESAW THAT THE BROADCAST REVEALED THE WAY POLITICIANS COULD USE THE POWER OF MASS COMMUNICATIONS TO CREATE THEATRICAL ILLUSIONS, TO MANIPULATE THE PUBLIC."

2 "...MAJESTIC-12 DOCUMENTS."
"MAJESTIC 12" OR "MJ-12". (NOTE: ALL OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AND/OR ASSERTIONS CONCERNING THE MJ-12 DOCUMENTS ARE THOSE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: HTTP://WWW.MAJESTICDOCUMENTS.COM/)


"OPERATION MAJESTIC-12 WAS ESTABLISHED BY SPECIAL CLASSIFIED PRESIDENTIAL ORDER ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1947 AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES FORRESTAL AND DR. VANNEVAR BUSH, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD. THE GOAL OF THE GROUP WAS TO EXPLOIT EVERYTHING THEY COULD FROM RECOVERED ALIEN TECHNOLOGY.


BURIED IN A SUPER-SECRET "MAJIC EYES ONLY" CLASSIFICATION THAT WAS ABOVE TOP SECRET — LONG BEFORE THE MODERN TOP SECRET CODEWORD SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMS OF TODAY — MAJOR GENERAL LESLIE R. GROVES (WHO COMMANDED THE MANHATTAN PROJECT TO DELIVER THE ATOMIC BOMB) KEPT JUST ONE COPY OF THE DETAILS OF CRASHED ALIEN TECHNOLOGY IN HIS SAFE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.


AMBITIOUS, ELITE SCIENTISTS SUCH AS VANNEVAR BUSH, ALBERT EINSTEIN, AND ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, AND CAREER MILITARY PEOPLE SUCH AS HOYT VANDENBERG, ROSCOE HILLENKOETTER, LESLIE GROVES, AND GEORGE MARSHALL, ALONG WITH A SELECT CAST OF OTHER EXPERTS, FEVERISHLY AND SECRETIVELY LABORED TO UNDERSTAND THE ALIEN AGENDA, TECHNOLOGY, AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS.


EINSTEIN AND OPPENHEIMER WERE CALLED IN TO GIVE THEIR OPINION, DRAFTING A SIX-PAGE PAPER TITLED "RELATIONSHIPS WITH INHABITANTS OF CELESTIAL BODIES." THEY PROVIDED PROPHETIC INSIGHT INTO OUR MODERN NUCLEAR STRATEGIES AND SATELLITES, AND EXPRESSED AGITATED URGENCY THAT AN AGREEMENT BE REACHED WITH THE PRESIDENT SO THAT SCIENTISTS COULD PROCEED TO STUDY THE ALIEN TECHNOLOGY.


THE EXTRAORDINARY RECOVERY OF FALLEN AIRBORNE OBJECTS IN THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO, BETWEEN JULY 4 - JULY 6, 1947, CAUSED THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMY AIR FORCE'S INTERPLANETARY PHENOMENA UNIT, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL BRANCH, COUNTERINTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE TO INITIATE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. THE SPECIAL UNIT WAS FORMED IN 1942 IN RESPONSE TO TWO CRASHES IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA IN LATE FEBRUARY 1942. THE DRAFT SUMMARY REPORT BEGINS "AT 2332 MST, 3 JULY 47, RADAR STATIONS IN EAST TEXAS AND WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUND, N. M. TRACKED TWO UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY BOTH DROPPED OFF RADAR. TWO CRASH SITES HAVE BEEN LOCATED CLOSE TO THE WSPG. SITE LZ-1 WAS LOCATED AT A RANCH NEAR CORONA, APPROX. 75 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE TOWN OF ROSWELL. SITE LZ-2 WAS LOCATED APPROX. 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE TOWN OF SOCORRO, AT LATITUDE 33-40-31 AND LONGITUDE 106-28-29".


THE FIRST-EVER-KNOWN UFO CRASH RETRIEVAL CASE OCCURRED IN 1941 IN CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI. THIS CRASH KICKED OFF EARLY REVERSE-ENGINEERING WORK, BUT IT DID NOT CREATE A UNIFIED INTELLIGENCE EFFORT TO EXPLOIT POSSIBLE TECHNOLOGICAL GAINS APART FROM THE MANHATTAN PROJECT USES.
THE DEBRIS FROM THE PRIMARY FIELD OF THE 1947 CRASH 20 MILES SOUTHEAST OF SOCORRO, NEW MEXICO WAS CALLED ULAT-1 (UNIDENTIFIED LENTICULAR AERODYNE TECHNOLOGY), AND IT EXCITED METALLURGISTS WITH ITS UNHEARD-OF TENSILE AND SHEAR STRENGTHS. THE FUSION NUCLEAR (CALLED NEUTRONIC AT THAT TIME) ENGINE USED HEAVY WATER AND DEUTERIUM WITH AN ODDLY ARRANGED SERIES OF COILS, MAGNETS, AND ELECTRODES — DESCRIPTIONS THAT RESEMBLE THE "COLD FUSION" STUDIES OF TODAY.


HARRY TRUMAN KEPT THE TECHNICAL BRIEFING DOCUMENTS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 1947 FOR FURTHER STUDY, PONDERING THE CHALLENGES OF CREATING AND FUNDING A SECRET ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CIA EXISTED (ALTHOUGH THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE GROUP OR CIG DID EXIST) AND BEFORE THERE WAS A LEGAL PROCEDURE OF FUNDING NON-WAR OPERATIONS.


IN APRIL 1954, A GROUP OF SENIOR OFFICERS OF THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE ARMED FORCES GATHERED FOR ONE OF THE MOST SECRET AND SENSATIONAL BRIEFINGS IN HISTORY. THE SUBJECT WAS UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS — NOT JUST A DISCUSSION OF SIGHTINGS, BUT HOW TO RECOVER CRASHED UFOS, WHERE TO SHIP THE PARTS, AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE OCCUPANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE "SPECIAL OPERATIONS MANUAL (SOM1-01) EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES TECHNOLOGY RECOVERY AND DISPOSAL," MAJESTIC-12 "RED TEAMS" MAPPED OUT UFO CRASH RETRIEVAL SCENARIOS WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN TO PRESS BLACKOUTS, BODY PACKAGING, AND LIVE ALIEN TRANSPORT, ISOLATION, AND CUSTODY.


MAJESTIC DOCUMENTS.COM IS NOT ANOTHER REHASH OF THE FAMOUS ROSWELL STORY — IT CONTAINS OVER 500 PAGES (AND GROWING) OF NEWLY SURFACED DOCUMENTS, MANY OF WHICH DATE YEARS BEFORE THE ROSWELL CRASH. UNLIKE OTHER WEBSITES, A CENTRAL THEME OF VALIDATING AUTHENTICITY IS WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE SITE WHILE TELLING THE EXCITING STORY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S WORK ON RETRIEVAL AND ANALYSIS OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL HARDWARE AND ALIEN LIFE FORMS FROM 1941 TO PRESENT."

3 "LIKE RIPLEY SAID..."
ROBERT LEROY RIPLEY (DECEMBER 25, 1893 - MAY 27, 1949) WAS A CARTOONIST, ENTREPRENEUR, AND AMATEUR ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO CREATED THE WORLD FAMOUS RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT! NEWSPAPER PANEL SERIES, FEATURING ODD BUT TRUE FACTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. SUBJECTS COVERED IN RIPLEY'S CARTOONS AND TEXT RANGED FROM SPORTS FEATS TO LITTLE KNOWN FACTS ABOUT UNUSUAL AND EXOTIC SITES, BUT WHAT ENSURED THE CONCEPT'S POPULARITY MAY HAVE BEEN THAT RIPLEY ALSO INCLUDED ITEMS SUBMITTED BY READERS, WHO SUPPLIED PHOTOGRAPHS OF A WIDE VARIETY OF SMALL TOWN AMERICAN TRIVIA, RANGING FROM UNUSUALLY SHAPED VEGETABLES TO ODDLY MARKED DOMESTIC ANIMALS, ALL DOCUMENTED BY PHOTOGRAPHS AND THEN ENGAGINGLY DEPICTED BY RIPLEY'S PROLIFIC PEN."

ABOUT THE SOURCE OF MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK


THE CONTENT OF THIS BOOK IS PRIMARILY EXCERPTED FROM THE LETTER, INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS AND PERSONAL NOTES I RECEIVED FROM THE LATE MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY. HER LETTER TO ME ASSERTS THAT THIS MATERIAL IS BASED ON HER RECOLLECTION OF COMMUNICATION WITH AN ALIEN BEING, WHO "SPOKE" WITH HER TELEPATHICALLY.

 

DURING JULY AND AUGUST OF 1947 SHE INTERVIEWED AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEING WHO SHE IDENTIFIES AS "AIRL", AND WHOM SHE CLAIMS WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER WHO WAS RECOVERED FROM A FLYER SAUCER THAT CRASHED NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO ON JULY 8TH, 1947.


OBVIOUSLY, ANYONE READING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOST FAMOUS, OR INFAMOUS, OF ALL "FLYING SAUCER" OR "ALIEN ENCOUNTER" EVENTS MUST NECESSARILY BE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS REGARDING:

THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE REPORT

THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT APPEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED EVENT!

I RECEIVED THE AFOREMENTIONED LETTER FROM MRS. MACELROY ON SEPTEMBER 14TH, 2007, TOGETHER WITH A PACKAGE OF DOCUMENTS. THE PACKAGE CONTAINED THREE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS:

HAND-WRITTEN NOTES IN CURSIVE ON ORDINARY, LINED, 8 1/2" X 11"SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, WHICH I ASSUME HAD BEEN WRITTEN PERSONALLY BY MRS. MACELROY.

NOTES TYPED ON A MANUAL TYPEWRITER ON PLAIN, WHITE 20 LB. BOND PAPER, WHICH I AM ASSUME WERE PREPARED PERSONALLY BY HER. AT LEAST BOTH HAD THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN WRITTEN IN THE SAME HAND WRITING, AND / OR TYPED ON THE SAME TYPEWRITER CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT. THE WRITING IN THE NOTES I RECEIVED ALSO APPEARED TO BE THE SAME AS THE WRITING ON THE ADDRESS AND RETURN ADDRESS OF THE MANILA ENVELOPE I RECEIVED FROM NAVAN, IRELAND, WHICH WAS POSTMARKED ON 3 SEPTEMBER, 2007. SINCE I AM NOT A FORENSIC EXPERT, OR HANDWRITING ANALYST, MY OPINION IN THESE MATTER IS NOT A PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED JUDGMENT.

MANY PAGES OF TYPEWRITTEN TRANSCRIPTIONS OF HER INTERVIEW WITH THE ALIEN. THESE WERE OBVIOUSLY TYPED ON A DIFFERENT TYPEWRITER. THESE PAGES WERE TYPED ON A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PAPER AND SHOWED APPARENT SIGNS OF AGE AND REPEATED HANDLING.

NONE OF THESE NOTES WERE ASSEMBLED IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER, OR BY DATE, EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED BY A SENTENCE OR PARAGRAPH OF PREAMBLE OR EXPLANATION BY HER, OR BY EXTRAPOLATION FROM THE CONTEXT OF THE PAGES.


VOLTAIRE 4 (FOOTNOTE) IS QUOTED AS HAVING SAID:

"HISTORY IS A MISSISSIPPI OF LIES".

ACCORDING TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE ALIEN IN THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS, SUPPLIED BY MRS. MACELROY, THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON OF HISTORY IS THAT MANY, MANY GODS HAVE BECOME MEN, BUT VERY FEW MEN, IF ANY, HAVE RETURNED TO BEING A GOD AGAIN.


ACCORDING TO THE ALIEN BEING - "AIRL" - IF ANYTHING HE / SHE / IT SUPPOSEDLY COMMUNICATED CAN BE TRUSTED - AND IF THE "TRANSLATION" OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS ALLEGED COMMUNICATION IS ACCURATE, THE HISTORY OF THIS UNIVERSE IS A "RIVER OF LIES" DOWN WHICH THE MIGHT AND FREEDOM OF ALL-POWERFUL, GOD-LIKE, IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS ENDED AND WAS LOST IN A SEA OF MATTER AND MORTALITY.


FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO THE VERY DIRECT AND UNDIPLOMATIC STATEMENTS MADE - WHICH SEEM TO EXPRESS THE "PERSONAL OPINION" OF THE ALIEN - IF ONE WERE TRAVELING THE FAR REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE IN SEARCH OF A PLACE CALLED "HELL", IT WOULD BE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF EARTH AND THE INHABITANTS IN ITS CURRENT CONDITION.
 

TO FURTHER COMPOUND, COMPLICATE AND MAGNIFY THE "INCREDIBLE" SOURCE OF THE "INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTIONS" I RECEIVED FROM MRS. MACELROY IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE:

BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON "TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION" BETWEEN THE ALIEN AND MRS. MACELROY

MANY OF THESE INTERVIEWS DISCUSS "PARANORMAL" ACTIVITIES OF "IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS"

OF COURSE, MOST "SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITIES" ARE UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR PERCEIVE SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA OF ANY KIND.


THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF THE WORD PARANORMAL IS:

ADJECTIVE:
1. CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS
2. SUPERNATURAL, OR SEEMINGLY OUTSIDE "NORMAL" SENSORY CHANNELS

BY DEFINITION, PEOPLE WHO USE THE WORD "PARANORMAL" ARE 1) NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA AND 2) SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR NORMAL SENSORY CHANNELS.


IN SHORT, SCIENTISTS SUFFER FROM THE INABILITY AND/OR UNWILLINGNESS TO PERCEIVE AND/OR EXPLAIN SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, THE DISCUSSION OF SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES OR SPIRITUAL UNIVERSES IN THIS BOOK ARE EXPECTED TO BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY THOSE WHO CAN AND WILL PERCEIVE SUCH THINGS.


ACCORDING TO THE TIME SPANS RELATED BY THE ALIEN IN SEVERAL OF THE INTERVIEWS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPELLING AND HERETOFORE UNKNOWN REASONS THAT SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANY EXTRAORDINARY MISCALCULATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY EARTH SCIENTISTS REGARDING THE ORIGINS AND ANTIQUITY OF THE UNIVERSE, EARTH, LIFE FORMS AND EVENTS. OF COURSE, THESE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCURATE EITHER, AS TIME AND IT'S UGLY STEP-CHILD, HISTORY, ARE LARGELY SUBJECTIVE.


HOWEVER, IT CAN BE OBSERVED THAT, BY CONTRAST WITH INTERSTELLAR OR "MACROCOSMIC TIME", THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF RESIDENTS OF EARTH IS LIMITED TO A RELATIVELY MICROSCOPIC PERIOD OF TIME, COMPARED TO WHAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE "RECENT EVENTS" IN THE CHRONOLOGY OF AN SPACE TRAVEL CIVILIZATION, MUCH LESS THE ENTIRE TIME SPAN OF THE UNIVERSE.


THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD OF EARTH IS RECKONED, BY THE BEST GUESSES OF SCIENTISTS, TO BE ONLY ABOUT 4 BILLION YEARS. THE ANTIQUITY OF HOMO SAPIENS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY TEXTBOOKS IS ESTIMATED AT ONLY A FEW MILLION YEARS, AT MOST. EVEN THE ENTIRE BIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE EXISTED ON THIS PLANET FOR ONLY A FEW HUNDRED MILLION YEARS. AND, BY AND LARGE, THE PERSONAL MEMORY OF INDIVIDUAL BEINGS ON THIS PLANET IS LIMITED TO ONLY ONE LIFETIME.


ALL OTHER DATES, EVENTS, OR INTERPRETATIONS OF EVENTS CITED IN THIS BOOK ARE FROM TERRESTRIAL SOURCES, WHICH ARE PURELY SUBJECTIVE OBSERVATIONS, CONJECTURES, OR INVENTIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE AUTHOR, AND MUST THEREFORE BE CREDITED OR DISREGARDED BY THE READER ACCORDINGLY, CONSIDERING THE PENCHANT OF EARTH INHABITANTS TO MYOPIA, EGOCENTRICITY, AND GENERAL IGNORANCE OF THE SEVERAL UNIVERSES IN WHICH WE DWELL.


THIS BOOK IS INTENDED TO BE AN INFORMAL PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO ME, SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE FACT, OF A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS BETWEEN AN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT OFFICER, PILOT & ENGINEER AND AN ARMY AIR FORCE SURGICAL NURSE.

MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION

SINCE I HAVE NEVER MET MRS. MACELROY IN PERSON, AND SPOKE WITH HER OVER THE PHONE ONLY ONCE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, I CAN NOT VOUCH PERSONALLY FOR HER AS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. IN FACT, I CANNOT FACTUALLY SUBSTANTIATE THAT SUCH A PERSON ACTUALLY EXISTED, ACCEPT THAT I DID SPEAK WITH HER ON THE PHONE AND I RECEIVED HAND-WRITTEN MATERIAL IN THE MAIL WHICH WAS SENT FROM A PHYSICAL ADDRESS IN IRELAND.


WHEN I SPOKE TO HER ON THE PHONE IN 1998, I WAS LIVING IN FLORIDA. AT THE TIME OF OUR BRIEF PHONE INTERVIEW, MRS. MACELROY LIVED ON SCOTTY PRIDE DRIVE IN GLASGOW, MONTANA. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I MAILED A COPY OF MY BOOK, THE OZ FACTORS, TO HER AS A GIFT AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1999. I AM SURE SHE RECEIVED THE BOOK, BECAUSE SHE REFERS TO IT BY NAME IN THE LETTER I RECEIVED FROM IRELAND, AND SAYS THAT SHE READ IT.


I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET ABOUT GLASGOW, MONTANA FOR MY OWN INTEREST. GLASGOW WAS FOUNDED IN 1887 AS A RAILROAD TOWN THAT BECAME POPULAR DURING THE 1930S BECAUSE PRESIDENT FDR REQUESTED THAT FORT PECK DAM BE CONSTRUCTED THERE WHICH BECAME A HUGE SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THE GLASGOW AREA. IN THE 1960S THE POPULATION FLOURISHED UP TO 12,000 BECAUSE OF GLASGOW AIR FORCE BASE (SAC), WHICH WAS USED DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT AND THE EARLIER PART OF THE 'COLD WAR'. THE BASE WAS DEACTIVATED AND CLOSED IN 1969.


WHEN I TALKED TO MRS. MACELROY ON THE PHONE SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD BEEN RELOCATED THERE BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE AFTER HER SERVICE WAS COMPLETED, AND THAT'S WHERE SHE MET HER HUSBAND, WHO WAS AN ENGINEER. I DON'T THINK SHE MENTIONED HIS FIRST NAME. HOWEVER, HE WORKED ON BUILDING THE FORT PECK DAM, WHICH CREATED THE MASSIVE FORT PECK LAKE. ALTHOUGH THE DAM WAS FINISHED IN 1940, HE WAS A GREAT FISHERMAN AND OUTDOORSMAN, SO HE STAYED IN THE AREA.

 

I GATHERED THAT THE IRISH HERITAGE OF THE PLACE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT DIDN'T PURSUE THAT POINT WITH HER. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY RECORD OF A "MACELROY" WHO WORKED AT THE DAM, BUT THE PERSONNEL RECORDS FROM THAT PERIOD ARE VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT AS FAR AS I CAN DETERMINE.


I CONTACTED HER DURING MY RESEARCH FOR THE OZ FACTORS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS LED TO BELIEVE, THROUGH A VERY CIRCUITOUS LINE OF INVESTIGATION, THAT THIS WOMEN
WAS SUSPECTED OF HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH ALIEN CONTACT AT AREA 51, OR THE ROSWELL CRASH SITE, OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.


THROUGH A SEQUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL INFERENCES AND ACCIDENTAL REFERRALS, I ACTUALLY FOUND HER NUMBER IN THE PHONE BOOK AND CALLED HER UP JUST ON THE CHANCE THAT THERE MIGHT REALLY BE SUCH A PERSON.


NEEDLESS TO SAY, WHEN I CALLED HER SHE WAS LESS THAN FORTHCOMING IN HER RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, I THINK SHE WAS IMPRESSED BY MY GENUINE AND INNOCENT SINCERITY TO GET INFORMATION FOR MY BOOK, AND REALIZED THAT I HAD NO NEFARIOUS OR FINANCIALLY MOTIVATED PURPOSES OR REASON TO EXPLOIT HER IN ANY WAY.

 

NONETHELESS, SHE DID NOT GIVE ME ANY USEFUL INFORMATION AT THAT TIME, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE ARMY AND WAS STATIONED IN NEW MEXICO IN 1947.
SHE COULD NOT DISCUSS ANYTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT ANY KIND OF INCIDENT, AS HER LIFE DEPENDED ON REMAINING SILENT. ALTHOUGH THIS PIQUED MY INTEREST EVEN MORE, IT WAS FUTILE TO TRY TO PUSH HER ANY FURTHER, SO I GAVE UP AND FORGOT ABOUT HER UNTIL LAST SEPTEMBER, WHEN I GOT THE PACKAGE FROM IRELAND.


I TRIED TO CONTACT HER IN IRELAND AT THE RETURN ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE, BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY FROM HER, NOR HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANYONE IN MEATH COUNTY, IRELAND WHO WAS ACQUAINTED WITH EITHER OF THEM EXCEPT THE LANDLADY FROM WHOM THEY RENTED A ROOM FOR A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THEIR DEATHS, WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO REAL EVIDENCE OF THIS.


HOWEVER, THE POST MARK OF THE ENVELOPE SHE SENT TO ME WAS STAMPED AT THE POST OFFICE IN NAVAN, CO. MEATH, IRELAND ON THE DATE SITED ABOVE. SINCE THERE IS AN ACTUAL RESIDENCE (ACCORDING TO GOOGLE MAPS) AT THE RETURN ADDRESS SHOWN ON THE ENVELOPE, I WROTE TO THE ADDRESS AND WAS ADVISED BY THE HOME OWNER THAT BOTH MRS. MACELROY AND HER HUSBAND, WHOSE NAME TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN "PAUL", WERE BOTH RECENTLY DECEASED. SHE SAID THAT THE CREMATED REMAINS OF MRS. MACELROY AND HER HUSBAND WERE INTERRED AT SAINT FINIAN CEMETERY ON ATHBOY ROAD.


SUBSEQUENTLY, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY RECORD OF HER UNDER THE MAIDEN NAME OF O'DONNELL, NOR HAVE I HAD ANY SUCCESS AT DISCOVERING ANY PERSONAL FRIEND, FAMILY MEMBER OR DOCUMENT TO CONFIRM HER BIRTH, MEDICAL EDUCATION, OR MILITARY RECORD, MARRIAGE OR DEATH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER LANDLADY IN IRELAND (WHO IS NOT A RELATIVE) JUST BEFORE HER DEATH. I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS THE FALSE IDENTITY GIVEN TO HER BY THE MILITARY WHEN SHE LEFT ROSWELL, AS MENTIONED IN HER NOTES.


IN EITHER CASE, IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HER IDENTITY AND ALL EVIDENCE OF HER HAS BEEN EXPUNGED FROM THE PUBLIC RECORD. I UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAIN GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES ARE ADEPT AT COVERING UP EVIDENCE, OR MAKING RECORDS (AND PEOPLE) DISAPPEAR. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN HER CASE, DUE TO THE HIGHLY SENSITIVE NATURE OF THE ROSWELL INCIDENT AND CONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE ALLEGED "COVER UP".


INASMUCH AS I DO NOT HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION TO VERIFY OR SUBSTANTIATE THAT ANY OF THE NOTES OF THESE "INTERVIEWS" SENT TO ME BY MRS. MACELROY ARE IN ANY WAY FACTUAL, OTHER THAN WHAT I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED, LET THE READER BEWARE, AND TAKE HEED ACCORDINGLY!

THE LETTER FROM MRS. MACELROY

AUGUST 12, 2007

DEAR LAWRENCE,


I AM TYPING THIS LETTER TO YOU ON MY OLD UNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER THAT I BOUGHT AFTER I WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY. SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKE A FITTING CONTRAST TO THE SUBJECT OF THIS LETTER AND THE DOCUMENTS YOU WILL FIND ENCLOSED IN THIS ENVELOPE.


THE LAST TIME I SPOKE TO YOU WAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. DURING YOUR BRIEF TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH ME YOU ASKED ME TO ASSIST YOU WITH THE RESEARCH FOR "THE OZ FACTORS" BOOK YOU WERE WRITING BECAUSE YOU SUSPECTED THAT I MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP YOUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBILITY THAT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE HISTORY OF EARTH. WHEN WE SPOKE, I TOLD YOU THAT I DID NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT I COULD SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT ANYTHING.


SINCE THEN I HAVE READ YOUR BOOK AND FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING AND COMPELLING. YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A MAN WHO HAS DONE HIS HOMEWORK, AND WHO COULD UNDERSTAND MY OWN EXPERIENCES. I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT YOUR ALLUSION TO THE OLD PHILOSOPHER WHOM YOU PARAPHRASED IN OUR PHONE CONVERSATION: "WITH GREAT POWER, COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY". ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK POWER IS PERTINENT IN MY LIFE OR TO MY REASONS FOR SENDING YOU THE ENCLOSED DOCUMENTS, YOU CERTAINLY DID GET ME THINKING ABOUT MY RESPONSIBILITY.


I HAVE RECONSIDERED MY POSITION, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS MY REALIZATION THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. I DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MYSELF, AT LEAST. I CAN NOT POSSIBLY TELL YOU THE PERSONAL HELL 5 (FOOTNOTE) OF ETHICAL IRRESOLUTION AND SPIRITUAL AMBIVALENCE I HAVE ENDURED SINCE 1947. I DO NOT WANT TO KEEP PLAYING THE GAME OF "MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE, OR MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE", THROUGH THE REST OF ETERNITY!


MANY MEN HAVE BEEN KILLED TO EXTINGUISH THE POSSIBILITY OF REVEALING THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE HELPED TO WITHHOLD FROM SOCIETY, UNTIL NOW. ONLY A SMALL HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ON EARTH HAVE SEEN AND HEARD WHAT I HAVE HAD THE BURDEN OF KEEPING SECRET FOR SIXTY YEARS. ALL THOSE YEARS I THOUGHT THAT I HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE BY THE "POWERS THAT BE" IN OUR GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH I HAVE OFTEN FELT THAT POWER IS GREATLY MISGUIDED, TO "PROTECT" MANKIND FROM THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT, NOT ONLY DO INTELLIGENT EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FORMS EXIST, BUT THAT THEY HAVE AND CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY MONITOR AND INVADE THE LIVES OF EVERYONE ON EARTH EVERY DAY.


THEREFORE, I THINK THE TIME HAS COME TO PASS ALONG MY SECRET KNOWLEDGE TO SOMEONE I THINK WILL UNDERSTAND IT. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE OF ME TO TAKE THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE INTO THE SILENT AFTERLIFE, BEYOND REACH OR RECOGNITION. I THINK THERE IS A GREATER GOOD TO BE SERVED THAN PROTECTING THE "VESTED INTERESTS" FOR WHOM THIS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED A MATTER OF "NATIONAL SECURITY", WHATEVER THAT MEANS, AND IS THEREFORE JUSTIFICATION FOR MAKING IT "TOP SECRET". 6 (FOOTNOTE)


ALSO, I AM NOW 83 YEARS OLD. I HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THIS BODY, WHICH HAS OUTLASTED IT'S USEFULNESS TO ME, USING A PAINLESS METHOD OF SELF-ADMINISTERED EUTHANASIA. 7 (FOOTNOTE) I HAVE A VERY FEW MONTHS TO LIVE, AND NOTHING TO FEAR OR LOSE.


SO, I HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM MONTANA, WHERE MY HUSBAND AND I LIVED FOR MOST OF MY LIFE, TO SPEND OUR REMAINING DAYS IN A LOVELY RENTED UPSTAIRS BEDROOM IN A HOUSE IN THE HOMELAND OF MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY IN COUNTY MEATH, IRELAND. 8 (FOOTNOTE)


I WILL DIE NOT FAR FROM "THE GREAT MOUND" AT KNOWTH 9 (FOOTNOTE), AND DOWTH, THE "FAIRY MOUND OF DARKNESS". THESE ARE SACRED "CAIRNS" OR MASSIVE STONE STRUCTURES THAT WERE ERECTED ABOUT 3,700 BCE AND ENGRAVED WITH INDECIPHERABLE HIEROGLYPHS - ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS PYRAMIDS AND OTHER INEXPLICABLE STONE MONUMENTS WERE BEING BUILT ALL OVER THE EARTH.


I AM ALSO NOT FAR FROM "THE HILL OF TARA", 10 (FOOTNOTE) THAT WAS ONCE THE ANCIENT SEAT OF POWER IN IRELAND WHERE 142 KINGS ARE SAID TO HAVE REIGNED IN PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC TIMES. IN ANCIENT IRISH RELIGION AND MYTHOLOGY THIS WAS THE SACRED PLACE OF DWELLING FOR THE "GODS" AND WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE "OTHER WORLD".


SAINT PATRICK CAME TO TARA TO CONQUER THE ANCIENT RELIGION OF THE PAGANS. HE MAY HAVE SUPPRESSED THE RELIGIOUS PRACTICES IN THE AREA, BUT HE CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE "GODS" WHO BROUGHT THESE CIVILIZATIONS TO EARTH, AS YOU WILL DISCOVER WHEN YOU READ THE DOCUMENTS ENCLOSED. THEREFORE, THIS IS A FITTING LOCATION FOR MY DEPARTURE FROM THIS UNHOLY WORLD AND FINAL RELEASE FROM THE BURDENS OF THIS LIFE.


THE CRYSTAL CLEAR PERSPECTIVE OF HINDSIGHT HAS REVEALED A HIGHER PURPOSE TO ME: ASSISTING THE SURVIVAL OF THE PLANET, ALL LIVING BEINGS AND LIFE FORMS IN OUR GALAXY!


THE STATUS QUO OF OUR GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENT HAS BEEN TO "PROTECT THE PEOPLE" FROM KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH MATTERS. IN FACT, THE ONLY PROTECTION AFFORDED BY IGNORANCE AND SECRECY IS TO HIDE THE PRIVATE AGENDA OF THOSE IN POWER TO ENSLAVE OTHERS. AND, BY DOING SO, TO DISARM EVERY PERCEIVED ENEMY, AND ALLY, THROUGH SUPERSTITION AND STUPIDITY.


THEREFORE, I HAVE ENCLOSED THE ORIGINAL AND ONLY EXISTING COPIES OF MY PERSONAL NOTES AND REFLECTIONS ON A MATTER WHICH I HAVE KEPT HIDDEN FROM EVERYONE, EVEN MY OWN FAMILY. I HAVE ALSO ENCLOSED MY COPIES OF TYPED TRANSCRIPTS CREATED BY THE STENOGRAPHER WHO TRANSCRIBED ALL OF MY INTERVIEWS WITH THE ALIEN SAUCER PILOT AFTER EACH INTERVIEW WAS FINISHED. I DO NOT HAVE ANY COPIES OF THE TAPE RECORDINGS THAT WERE MADE OF MY INTERVIEW REPORTS. NO ONE, UNTIL NOW, KNOWS THAT I WAS ABLE TO SECRETLY RETAIN COPIES OF THE OFFICIAL INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS.


NOW I AM ENTRUSTING THESE DOCUMENTS TO YOUR DISCRETION TO IMPART TO THE WORLD IN ANY FORM OR MANNER YOU SEE FIT. MY ONLY REQUEST IS THAT YOU DO SO IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT THREATEN YOUR OWN LIFE OR WELL BEING, IF POSSIBLE. IF YOU WERE TO INCORPORATE THESE NOTES OF MY EXPERIENCES INTO A WORK OF FICTION, SUCH AS A NOVEL, THE FACTUAL NATURE OF THE MATERIAL COULD BE EASILY DISMISSED OR DISCREDITED BY ANY AGENCY FOR WHOM "NATIONAL SECURITY" IS USED AS A PERSONAL SHIELD AGAINST SCRUTINY AND JUSTICE.


IN SO DOING, YOU COULD "DISAVOW ANY KNOWLEDGE" OF THEIR TRUE ORIGIN, AND CLAIM THAT IT IS A FICTITIOUS WORK OF YOUR IMAGINATION. WHOEVER SAID THAT "TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION" WAS "RIGHT AS RAIN". FOR MOST PEOPLE ALL OF THIS WILL BE "UNBELIEVABLE". UNFORTUNATELY, BELIEFS ARE NOT A RELIABLE CRITERIA FOR REALITY.


ALSO, I AM SURE THAT IF YOU WERE TO SHOW THESE NOTES TO ANYONE THAT WOULD PREFER PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC OR SPIRITUAL SLAVERY OVER FREEDOM, THE SUBJECT MATTER CONTAINED IN THEM WOULD SEEM QUITE OBJECTIONABLE. IF YOU ATTEMPTED TO PUBLISHED THE DOCUMENTS AS A MATTER OF FACTUAL REPORTING IN A NEWSPAPER OR ON THE EVENING TV NEWS THEY WOULD BE REJECTED OUT OF HAND AS THE WORK OF A KOOK. THE VERY NATURE OF THESE DOCUMENTS MAKE THEM UNBELIEVABLE, AND THEREFORE DISCREDITABLE. CONVERSELY, THE RELEASE OF THIS INFORMATION IS POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC FOR CERTAIN POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS AND ECONOMIC VESTED INTERESTS.


THESE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN INFORMATION WHICH IS QUITE RELEVANT TO YOUR INTEREST AND INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALIEN ENCOUNTERS AND PARANORMAL EXPERIENCE. TO USE YOUR ANALOGY IN "THE OZ FACTORS" BOOK, I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THE FEW FACTUAL REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY OTHERS ABOUT "ALIEN" INFLUENCES ARE ONLY A GENTLE BREEZE IN THE EYE OF AN APOCALYPTIC HURRICANE SWIRLING AROUND EARTH. THERE REALLY ARE WIZARDS AND WICKED WITCHES AND FLYING MONKEYS IN THIS UNIVERSE!


THIS INFORMATION, WHICH HAS BEEN SUSPECTED AND/OR SPECULATED UPON BY SO MANY FOR SO LONG, HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY DENIED BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA, ACADEMIA, AND THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX 11 (FOOTNOTE) THAT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WARNED US ABOUT IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS.

AS YOU KNOWN IN JULY,1947,THE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD (RAAF) 12 (FOOTNOTE) ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE STATING THAT PERSONNEL FROM THE FIELD'S 509TH BOMB GROUP HAD RECOVERED A CRASHED "FLYING DISC" FROM A RANCH NEAR ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO, SPARKING INTENSE MEDIA INTEREST. 13 (FOOTNOTE)


LATER THE SAME DAY, THE COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE EIGHTH AIR FORCE 14 (FOOTNOTE) STATED THAT MAJOR JESSE MARCEL, WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE ORIGINAL RECOVERY OF THE DEBRIS, HAD RECOVERED ONLY THE TATTERED REMNANTS OF A WEATHER BALLOON. THE TRUE FACTS OF THE INCIDENT HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SINCE THEN.


YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT I WAS ENLISTED IN THE U.S. WOMEN'S ARMY AIR FORCE (WAC) 15 (FOOTNOTE) MEDICAL CORP WHICH WAS A PART OF THE US ARMY BACK THEN. I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE 50 9TH BOMB GROUP AS A FLIGHT NURSE 16 (FOOTNOTE) AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.


WHEN THE NEWS THAT THERE HAD BEEN A CRASH WAS RECEIVED AT THE BASE, I WAS ASKED TO ACCOMPANY MR. CAVITT, THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 17 (FOOTNOTE) TO THE CRASH SITE AS THE DRIVER OF HIS VEHICLE, AND TO RENDER ANY NEEDED EMERGENCY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY SURVIVORS, IF NECESSARY. 18 (FOOTNOTE)

 

THEREFORE, I BRIEFLY WITNESSED THE WRECKAGE OF AN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT, AS WELL AS THE REMAINS OF THE SEVERAL ALIEN PERSONNEL ABOARD THE CRAFT WHO WERE ALREADY DEAD.


WHEN WE ARRIVED I LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE PERSONNEL ON BOARD THE CRAFT HAD SURVIVED THE CRASH, AND WAS CONSCIOUS, AND APPARENTLY UNINJURED. THE CONSCIOUS ALIEN WAS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE, BUT NOT THE SAME AS, THE OTHERS. 19 (FOOTNOTE)


NONE OF THE OTHER PERSONNEL PRESENT COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE SURVIVOR, AS THE BEING DID NOT COMMUNICATE VERBALLY OR BY ANY RECOGNIZABLE SIGNS. HOWEVER, WHILE I EXAMINED THE "PATIENT" FOR INJURIES I IMMEDIATELY DETECTED AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ALIEN BEING WAS ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME BY "MENTAL IMAGES", OR "TELEPATHIC THOUGHT", 20 (FOOTNOTE) WHICH PROJECTED DIRECTLY FROM THE MIND OF THE BEING.


I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS PHENOMENON TO MR. CAVITT. AS NO OTHER PERSON PRESENT COULD PERCEIVE THESE THOUGHTS, AND THE ALIEN SEEMED ABLE AND WILLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME, IT WAS DECIDED, AFTER A BRIEF CONSULTATION WITH A SENIOR OFFICER, THAT I WOULD ACCOMPANY THE SURVIVING ALIEN BACK TO THE BASE.


THIS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS A NURSE, AND COULD ATTEND TO THE PHYSICAL NEEDS OF THE ALIEN, AS WELL AS SERVE AS A NON-THREATENING COMMUNICATOR AND COMPANION. AFTER ALL, I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN AT THE SITE AND THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS NOT ARMED. I WAS THEREAFTER ASSIGNED PERMANENTLY TO SERVE AS A "COMPANION" OF THE ALIEN AT ALL TIMES. 21 (FOOTNOTE)


MY DUTY WAS TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND INTERVIEW THE ALIEN AND TO MAKE A COMPLETE REPORT OF ALL THAT I DISCOVERED TO COMMAND AUTHORITIES. SUBSEQUENTLY, I WAS SUPPLIED WITH SPECIFIC LISTS OF QUESTIONS PROVIDED TO ME BY MILITARY AND NON-MILITARY PERSONNEL, WHICH I WAS TO "INTERPRET" FOR THE ALIEN, AND RECORD THE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS PROVIDED.


I ALSO ACCOMPANIED THE ALIEN AT ALL TIMES DURING MEDICAL TESTING AND THE MANY OTHER EXAMINATIONS TO WHICH THE ALIEN WAS SUBJECTED BY STAFF FROM NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.


I WAS GIVEN A PROMOTION IN RANK TO SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT TO IMPROVE MY SECURITY RATING, AND TO INCREASE MY PAY GRADE FROM $54.00 A MONTH TO $138.00 A MONTH, FOR THIS VERY UNUSUAL ASSIGNMENT. I PERFORMED THESE DUTIES FROM JULY 7TH THROUGH AUGUST,1947,AT WHICH TIME THE ALIEN "DIED" OR DEPARTED THE "BODY", AS YOU WILL READ ABOUT IN MY NOTES.


ALTHOUGH I WAS NEVER LEFT ENTIRELY ALONE WITH THE ALIEN, AS THERE WERE ALWAYS MILITARY PERSONNEL, INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PEOPLE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER OFFICIALS PRESENT FROM TIME TO TIME, I DID HAVE UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS TO AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE ALIEN BEING FOR NEARLY SIX WEEKS.


HEREINAFTER IS AN OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF MY PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF "CONVERSATIONS" WITH THE ALIEN CRAFT PILOT, WHOM I CAME TO KNOW BY THE IDENTITY OF "AIRL".


I FEEL THAT IT IS MY DUTY AT THIS TIME, IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CITIZENS OF EARTH, TO REVEAL WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY INTERACTION WITH "AIRL" DURING THOSE SIX WEEKS, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER "DEATH" OR DEPARTURE SIXTY YEARS AGO.


ALTHOUGH I SERVED AS A NURSE IN THE ARMY AIR FORCE, I AM NOT A PILOT OR TECHNICIAN. FURTHER, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE SPACE CRAFT OR OTHER MATERIALS RECOVERED FROM THE CRASH SITE AT THAT TIME, OR THEREAFTER. TO THAT DEGREE IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNICATIONS I HAD WITH " AIRL" ARE BASED ON MY OWN SUBJECTIVE ABILITY TO INTERPRET THE MEANING OF THE THOUGHTS AND MENTAL IMAGES I WAS ABLE TO PERCEIVE.


OUR COMMUNICATION DID NOT CONSIST OF "SPOKEN LANGUAGE", IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE. INDEED, THE "BODY" OF THE ALIEN HAD NO "MOUTH" THROUGH WHICH TO SPEAK. OUR COMMUNICATION WAS BY TELEPATHY. AT FIRST, I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AIRL VERY CLEARLY. I COULD PERCEIVE IMAGES, EMOTIONS AND IMPRESSIONS, BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EXPRESS THESE VERBALLY. ONCE AIRL LEARNED THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, SHE WAS ABLE TO FOCUS HER THOUGHTS MORE PRECISELY USING SYMBOLS AND MEANINGS OF WORDS I COULD UNDERSTAND. LEARNING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WAS DONE AS A FAVOR TO ME. IT WAS MORE FOR MY OWN BENEFIT THAN HERS.


BY THE END OF OUR INTERVIEW SESSIONS, AND INCREASINGLY SINCE THEN, I HAVE BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE WITH TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION. I HAVE BECOME MORE ADEPT AT UNDERSTANDING AIRL'S THOUGHTS AS THOUGH THEY ARE MY OWN. SOMEHOW, HER THOUGHTS BECOME MY THOUGHTS. HER EMOTIONS ARE MY EMOTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS IS LIMITED BY HER WILLINGNESS AND INTENTION TO SHARE HER OWN, PERSONAL UNIVERSE WITH ME. SHE IS ABLE TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT COMMUNICATION I AM ALLOWED TO RECEIVE FROM HER.

 

LIKEWISE, HER EXPERIENCE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RELATIONSHIPS AND PURPOSES ARE UNIQUELY HER OWN.
 


THIS IS THE SYMBOL OF "THE DOMAIN"
THE DOMAIN IS A RACE OR CIVILIZATION OF WHICH AIRL, THE ALIEN I INTERVIEWED, IS AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER SERVING IN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE. THE SYMBOL REPRESENTS THE ORIGIN AND UNLIMITED BOUNDARY OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE, UNITED AND INTEGRATED INTO A VAST CIVILIZATION UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DOMAIN.


AIRL IS CURRENTLY STATIONED AT A BASE IN THE ASTEROID BELT WHICH SHE REFERS AS A "SPACE STATION" IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM OF EARTH. FIRST AND FOREMOST, AIRL IS HERSELF. SECONDARILY, SHE VOLUNTARILY SERVES AS AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER IN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE. IN THAT CAPACITY SHE HAS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, BUT SHE IS AT LEAVE TO COME AND GO AS SHE PLEASES ALSO.


PLEASE ACCEPT THIS MATERIAL AND MAKE IT KNOWN TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I REPEAT THAT IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO ENDANGER YOUR LIFE WITH THE POSSESSION OF THIS MATERIAL, NOR DO I REALLY EXPECT YOU TO BELIEVE ANY


OF IT EITHER. HOWEVER, I DO SENSE THAT YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE VALUE THAT SUCH KNOWLEDGE MAY HAVE TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO FACE THE REALITY OF
IT.
MANKIND NEEDS TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN THESE DOCUMENTS. WHO ARE WE? WHERE DID WE COME FROM? WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE ON EARTH? IS MANKIND ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? IF THERE IS INTELLIGENT LIFE ELSEWHERE WHY HAVE THEY NOT CONTACTED US?


IT IS VITAL THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES TO OUR SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL SURVIVAL IF WE FAIL TO TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO UNDO THE LONGSTANDING AND PERVASIVE EFFECTS OF ALIEN INTERVENTION ON EARTH.


PERHAPS THE INFORMATION IN THESE DOCUMENTS WILL SERVE AS A STEPPING STONE TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR MANKIND. I HOPE THAT YOU CAN BE MORE CLEVER, CREATIVE AND COURAGEOUS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS INFORMATION THAN I HAVE BEEN.


MAY THE GODS BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU.

* LUNAR MARIA (SINGULAR: MARE, TWO SYLLABLES) ARE LARGE, DARK, BASALTIC PLAINS ON EARTH'S MOON, FORMED BY ANCIENT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. THEY WERE DUBBED MARIA, LATIN FOR "SEAS", BY EARLY ASTRONOMERS WHO MISTOOK THEM FOR ACTUAL SEAS. THEY ARE LESS REFLECTIVE THAN THE "HIGHLANDS" AS A RESULT OF THEIR IRON-RICH COMPOSITIONS, AND HENCE APPEAR DARK TO THE NAKED EYE. THE MARIA COVER ABOUT 16% OF THE LUNAR SURFACE, MOSTLY ON THE NEAR-SIDE VISIBLE FROM EARTH. THE FEW MARIA ON THE FAR-SIDE ARE MUCH SMALLER, RESIDING MOSTLY IN VERY LARGE CRATERS WHERE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF FLOODING OCCURRED. — REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA


THE MYTHOLOGY ABOUT DOWTH SPEAKS OF A HULL AND SEVEN COWS, IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE SITE HAS SOME CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTELLATION OF TAURUS, THE BULL, WHICH CONTAINS THE OPEN CLUSTER THE PLEIADES, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "THE SEVEN SISTERS". THIS CONSTELLATION WAS VERY IMPORTANT AROUND THE YEAR 3000BC, WHEN THE BOYNE VALLEY MOUNDS WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED, AS IT CONTAINED THE SUN ON THE SPRING EQUINOX, THAT VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT OF THE YEAR WHEN THE SUN'S PATH ALONG THE ECLIPTIC CROSSED THE CELESTIAL EQUATOR HEADING NORTHWARDS. IT IS THE SUN'S POSITION AMONG THE ZODIAC STARS AT THIS TIME WHICH DETERMINES THE CURRENT 'AGE' - I.E. THE "AGE OF TAURUS".


ANOTHER INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHICH OCCURS AT THIS TIME IS WHAT IS KNOWN TO ASTRONOMERS AS A 'HELIACAL RISING' OF THE PLEIADES. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE STARS IN QUESTION RISE AT THE EASTERN HORIZON BUT ARE QUICKLY LOST IN THE GLARE OF THE RISING SUN. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE EGYPTIANS, AND THE DOGON TRIBE IN AFRICA, (SEE: THE OZ FACTORS) AMONG OTHERS, USED THE SAME DOWTH-LIKE 'SUN-WHEEL' SYMBOLS TO SIGNIFY A HELIACAL RISING.
 

IF THESE 'SUN-WHEEL' SYMBOLS DO REPRESENT THE HELIACAL RISING OF THE PLEIADES, IT TELLS US SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE NEOLITHIC PEOPLE - THEY WERE AWARE OF THE GREAT CYCLE OF PRECESSION, THE SLOW WOBBLE OF THE EARTH'S AXIS WHICH CAUSES THE CELESTIAL POLE TO SHIFT OVER TIME, RESULTING IN THE VERNAL EQUINOX POINT, THAT PLACE WHERE THE SUN CROSSES THE CELESTIAL EQUATOR, MOVING BACKWARDS, OR WESTWARDS, THROUGH THE ZODIAC OVER A HUGE 25,800-YEAR PERIOD.

 

THIS VERNAL POINT MOVES JUST ONE DEGREE (ABOUT TWO WIDTHS OF THE FULL MOON) EVERY 72 YEARS, AND SPENDS ON AVERAGE 2,150 YEARS IN EACH OF THE TWELVE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE ZODIAC."

11 "...THE MILITARY - INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THAT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WARNED US ABOUT IN
HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS..."


"A MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX (MIC) IS COMPOSED OF A NATION'S ARMED FORCES, ITS SUPPLIERS OF WEAPONS SYSTEMS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, AND ITS CIVIL GOVERNMENT.


THE TERM "MIC" IS MOST OFTEN USED IN REFERENCE TO THE UNITED STATES, WHERE IT GAINED POPULARITY AFTER ITS USE IN THE FAREWELL ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. IN THE PENULTIMATE DRAFT OF THE ADDRESS, EISENHOWER INITIALLY USED THE TERM MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL-CONQRESSIONAL COMPLEX, AND THUS INDICATED THE ESSENTIAL ROLE THAT THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS PLAYS IN THE PROPAGATION OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRY. BUT, IT IS SAID, THAT THE PRESIDENT
CHOSE TO STRIKE THE WORD CONGRESSIONAL \R\ ORDER TO PLACATE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.


IT IS SOMETIMES USED MORE BROADLY TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE NETWORK OF CONTRACTS AND FLOWS OF MONEY AND RESOURCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONS OF THE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THE PENTAGON, AND THE CONGRESS AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS SECTOR IS INTRINSICALLY PRONE TO PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEM, MORAL HAZARD, AND RENT SEEKING. CASES OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION HAVE ALSO SURFACED WITH REGULARITY.


PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (AND FORMER GENERAL OF THE ARMY) DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER LATER USED THE TERM IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON JANUARY 17,1961:

"A VITAL ELEMENT IN KEEPING THE PEACE IS OUR MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT. OUR ARMS MUST BE MIGHTY, READY FOR INSTANT ACTION, SO THAT NO POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR MAY BE TEMPTED TO RISK HIS OWN DESTRUCTION...


THIS CONJUNCTION OF AN IMMENSE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AND A LARGE ARMS INDUSTRY IS NEW IN THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. THE TOTAL INFLUENCE — ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, EVEN SPIRITUAL — IS FELT IN EVERY CITY, EVERY STATEHOUSE, EVERY OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPERATIVE NEED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT. YET WE MUST NOT FAIL TO COMPREHEND ITS GRAVE IMPLICATIONS. OUR TOIL, RESOURCES AND LIVELIHOOD ARE ALL INVOLVED; SO IS THE VERY STRUCTURE OF OUR SOCIETY.


IN THE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT, WE MUST GUARD AGAINST THE ACQUISITION OF UNWARRANTED INFLUENCE, WHETHER SOUGHT OR UNSOUGHT, BY THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DISASTROUS RISE OF MISPLACED POWER EXISTS AND WILL PERSIST.


WE MUST NEVER LET THE WEIGHT OF THIS COMBINATION ENDANGER OUR LIBERTIES OR DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. WE SHOULD TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. ONLY AN ALERT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE CITIZENRY CAN COMPEL THE PROPER MESHING OF THE HUGE INDUSTRIAL AND MILITARY MACHINERY OF DEFENSE WITH OUR PEACEFUL METHODS AND GOALS SO THAT SECURITY AND LIBERTY MAY PROSPER TOGETHER."

CAN BE VIEWED AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: — HTTP://ROSWEL IPROOF .HORN ESTEAD. COM/INDEX, HTML
 

'WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CONTENTS OF THE MESSAGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH WITNESS TESTIMONY, THE EVIDENCE CLEARLY POINTS TO AN ACTUAL FLYING SAUCER CRASH, AS ASTONISHING AS THIS CONCLUSION MAY SEEM TO MANY.


THIS TESTIMONY IS GONE INTO IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL ELSEWHERE IN THIS WEBSITE. IT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NUMEROUS AND CONSISTENT DESCRIPTIONS OF HIGHLY ANOMALOUS DEBRIS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT OF ALIEN BODIES. HERE ARE A FEW KEY WITNESSES:


MAJOR JESSE MARCEL: THEN THE INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AT ROSWELL AND THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE SHEEP RANCHER MACK BRAZEL'S FIND, MARCEL CONFIRMED IN A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS 30 YEARS LATER THAT THE CRASH DEBRIS HAD HIGHLY ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES AND WAS "NOT OF THIS EARTH." MARCEL ALSO SPOKE OF RAMEY'S WEATHER BALLOON COVER-UP AT FORT WORTH. NOTE PARTICULARLY HIGHLY LAUDATORY POST-ROSWELL EVALUATIONS BY BASE COMMANDER COL. WILLIAM BLANCHARD, GEN. RAMEY, AND MURE USAF CHIEF OF STAFF COL. JOHN RYAN.


LT WALTER HAUT FORMER ROSWELL BASE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER WHO ISSUED THE BASE PRESS RELEASE. HAUT'S "DEATHBED" SEALED AFFIDAVIT HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED. IN IT HE CONFESSES TO SEEING THE SPACECRAFT AND BODIES IN BASE HANGAR 84/P-3 AND TELLS US THE MYSTERIOUS PRESS RELEASE WAS GENERAL RAMEY'S IDEA TO DIVERT PRESS AND PUBLIC ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE CLOSER AND MORE IMPORTANT CRAFT/BODY SITE.
SETT FREDERICK BENTHAL: ARMY PHOTOGRAPHER FLOWN IN FROM WASHINGTON D.C., SAID HE PHOTOGRAPHED ALIEN BODIES IN A TENT AT CRASH SITE AND SAW LARGE QUANTITIES OF CRASH DEBRIS BEING HAULED AWAY IN TRUCKS.


PFC ELIAS BENJAMIN: ROSWELL MP, SAID HE ESCORTED THE ALIEN BODIES FROM THE HEAVILY GUARDED BASE HANGAR P-3 TO THE BASE HOSPITAL, AND SAW A LIVE ONE BEING WORKED ON BY DOCTORS; WAS THREATENED AFTERWARDS IF HE DIDN'T KEEP QUIET.


1ST LT. CHESTER P. BARTON: A CRYPTO SPECIALIST AND ASSIGNED TO AN MP UNIT, BARTON SAID HE WAS ORDERED TO THE CRASH SITE 45 MINUTES NORTH OF TOWN TO CHECK ON THE CLEANUP, SAW A FOOTBALL-FIELD-SIZE BUM IMPACT AREA HEAVILY GUARDED BY MPS, SCATTERED METAL DEBRIS, WAS TOLD RADIATION WAS AT THE SITE, HEARD ARCHEOLOGISTS HAD FIRST DISCOVERED IT, AND ALSO HEARD BODIES WERE TAKEN TO BASE HOSPITAL AND THEN TO FORT WORTH. BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAW, HE KNEW THAT THE BALLOON EXPLANATION WAS RIDICULOUS AND THERE HAD BEEN A COVER-UP. HOWEVER, BARTON WAS UNUSUAL IN BEING A FLYING SAUCER CRASH SKEPTIC, INSTEAD THINKING THAT IT WAS MAYBE A B-29 CRASH AND NUCLEAR ACCIDENT.


BILL BRAZEL JR.: RANCHER MACK BRAZEL'S SON, BILL BRAZEL INDEPENDENTLY CORROBORATED MANY DETAILS OF MARCEL'S TESTIMONY, INCLUDING THE STRANGE DEBRIS, THE LARGE, ELONGATED DEBRIS FIELD, AND HIS FATHEFS STORY OF AN EXPLOSION IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIOLENT ELECTRICAL STORM.
LOUIS RICKETT: ONE OF THE REGULAR ARMY CIC AGENTS IN MARCEL'S OFFICE, RICKETT CONFIRMED THE ANOMALOUS QUALITY OF THE DEBRIS, A MAJOR CLEANUP OPERATION AT BRAZEL'S RANCH, HIGH SECRECY, AND BEING INVOLVED IN A SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE CRAFT. HE WAS ALSO TOLD BY OTHERS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE MAIN CRAFT. LIKE CHESTER BARTON, HE PLACED THE MAIN IMPACT SITE A 45 MINUTE DRIVE NORTH OF ROSWELL.

BRIG. GEN. ARTHUREXON: THOUGH NOT A DIRECT PARTICIPANT, EXON WAS STATIONED AT WRIGHT FIELD AT THE TIME, OVERFLEW THE AREA SOON AFTERWARDS, AND WAS LATER COMMANDING OFFICER OF WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB. EXON WHEN FIRST INTERVIEWED FLATLY STATED, "ROSWELL WAS THE RECOVERY OF A CRAFT FROM SPACE." AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF TWO MAIN CRASH SITES. EXON ALSO SAID HE HEARD THAT BODIES WERE RECOVERED AND CONFIRMED THE DEBRIS WAS HIGHLY ANOMALOUS BASED ON TESTING DONE BY LABS AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON. EXON ADDED THAT HE WAS AWARE OF OTHER CRASH-RECOVERIES THAT OCCURRED WHILE HE WAS C/0 AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON.


STEVEN LOVEKIN (SERVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE ARMY SIGNAL CORP DURING EISENHOWER AND KENNEDY ADMINISTRATIONS, 1959-1961) ALTHOUGH LIKE EXON NOT A DIRECT PARTICIPANT, LOVEKIN SAID HE RECEIVED 1959 PENTAGON BRIEFINGS AND BEING SHOWN A METALLIC BEAM WITH SYMBOLS FROM A 1947 N.M. CRASH (PRESUMABLY ROSWELL) PLUS BEING TOLD OF EITHER 3 OR 5 ALIENS BEING RECOVERED, ONE INITIALLY ALIVE. HE ALSO SAID HE WAS SHOWN VERY COMPELLING PHOTOGRAPHIC AND RADAR EVIDENCE OF UFOS. HE ALSO TESTIFIED OF THE THREATS AGAINST MILITARY PERSONNEL GIVEN THIS INFORMATION IF THEY WERE TO PUBLICLY REVEAL IT. FINALLY, HE TOLD OF EISENHOWER'S CONCERN OVER LOSING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION WITH POWER FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF PRIVATE CORPORATIONS GIVEN ACCESS TO THE MATERIALS.


BRIG. GEN. THOMAS DUBOSE: GEN. RAMEY'S CHIEF OF STAFF IN 1947, DUBOSE HANDLED THE HIGH-LEVEL PHONE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ROSWELL, FORT WORTH, AND WASHINGTON. DUBOSE WENT ON RECORD MANY TIMES ABOUT THE HIGH SECRECY INVOLVED (INCLUDING THE MATTER GOING DIRECTLY TO THE WHITE HOUSE), RECEIVING DIRECT ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON TO INSTIGATE A COVER-UP, GEN. RAMEY'S WEATHER BALLOON COVER STORY, AND A HIGHLY SECRET SHIPMENT OF DEBRIS FROM ROSWELL TO FORT WORTH, WASHINGTON, AND WRIGHT FIELD. DUHOSE'S DAMNING TESTIMONY MADE HIM A COMPLETE NONENTITY IN THE AIR FORCE'S 1995 ROSWELL REPORT, WHICH DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO IDENTIFY HIM IN THE PHOTOS TAKEN OF GEN. RAMEY WITH HIS WEATHER BALLOON. (VISIT THE WEBSITE TO VIEW DUBOSE'S AIR FORCE BIOGRAPHY, HIS SWORN AFFIDAVIT, AND A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF HIS TESTIMONY WHICH THE AIR FORCE WAS SO EAGER TO AVOID.)


SGT ROBERT SLUSHERAND PFC LLOYD THOMPSON: CREW MEMBERS ON A MYSTERIOUS B-29 FLIGHT FROM ROSWELL TO FORT WORTH ON JULY 9, 1947, TRANSPORTING A LARGE WOODEN CRATE IN THE BOMB BAY SURROUNDED BY AN ARMED GUARD. UPON ARRIVAL, THE PLANE WAS MET BY HIGH BRASS AND A MORTICIAN.

THE NURSE SUBSEQUENTLY DISAPPEARED. HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY THE MYSTERY NURSE HAVE PROVEN TO BE A COMPLETE FAILURE AFTER DENNIS PROVIDED A FALSE NAME. HOWEVER, ALSO SEE SOME CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING DENNIS' AFFIDAVIT, SUCH AS DAVID WAGNON. A MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, WHO REMEMBERED THE NURSE FITTING DENNIS' DESCRIPTION, AS DID PETE ANAYA, WHO SAID THE PRETTY NURSE HE KNEW AND ENCOUNTERED AT THE BASE HANGAR TELLING HIM OF THE BODIES THERE SUBSEQUENTLY DISAPPEARED.


ROSWELL POLICE CHIEF L. M. HALL STATED THAT DENNIS WAS TELLING HIM OF CALLS FROM THE BASE ABOUT SMALL COFFINS FOR THE ALIENS ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE CRASHED SAUCER STORY BROKE IN THE ROSWELL PAPERS. SIMILARLY, S/SGT.

EARL ZIMMERMAN: FORMERLY WITH AFOSI (AF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE). WHILE IN OFFICERS' CLUB HEARD MANY RUMORS ABOUT FLYING SAUCER CRASH AND OF IT BEING INVESTIGATED UNDER THE GUISE OF AN AIRPLANE CRASH. SEVERAL TIMES OBSERVED GEN. RAMEY AND CHARLES LINDBERGH BEING AT BASE UNANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS. LIKE ROBERT SMITH, SPOKE OF SEEING AN UNKNOWN CIC MAN BEING AT BASE. COL. BLANCHARD TOLD HIM IT WAS OK. LATER WORKED WITH ASTRONOMER DR. LINCOLN LAPAZ AND CORROBORATED STORY OF ROSWELL CIC MAN LEWIS RICKETT THAT LAPAZ INVESTIGATED ROSWELL AFTERWARDS WITH THE HELP OF THE CIC TO TRY TO DETERMINE OBJECTS TRAJECTORY. AGAIN AN AIRPLANE CRASH WAS THE COVER STORY.


LL ROBERT SHIRKEY: THEN THE ASSISTANT OPERATIONS OFFICER, SHIRKEY WITNESSED THE LOADING OF THE ROBERT PORTER, HE ALSO STATED THAT THE PLANE'S PILOT WAS DEPUTY COMMANDING OFFICER LT. COL. PAYNE JENNINGS, WHO WAS NOW THE ACTING C/0 WITH COL. BLANCHARD OFFICIALLY ON LEAVE. NINE DAYS LATER. SHIRKEY WAS ABRUPTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE PHILIPPINES TO A POST THAT DIDN'T EXIST.

LORETTA PROCTOR: NEIGHBOR OF RANCHER MACK BRAZEL. BRAZEL TOLD HER AND HER HUSBAND OF FINDING STRANGE MATERIAL BEFORE GOING TO ROSWELL, AND SHOWING THEM A WOOD-LIKE PIECE THAT COULDN'T BE CUT OR BURNED. THEY ADVISED HIM TO GO TO ROSWELL AND REPORT IT. BRAZEL WAS DETAINED AT THE BASE AND COMPLAINED BITTERLY OF HIS TREATMENT WHEN HE RETURNED.


SALLY STRICKLAND TADOLINI: ANOTHER NEIGHBOR OF BRAZEL'S. ALTHOUGH ONLY 9 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, REMEMBERED MACK BRAZEL'S GROWN SON BILL BRAZEL BRINGING OVER A PIECE OF METALLIC-LOOKING DEBRIS WITH MEMORY PROPERTIES TO SHOW TO HER FAMILY (INCIDENT CORROBORATED BY HER MOTHER). DESCRIBED IT AS TOUGH, RESEMBLED A SMOOTH 'FABRIC" LIKE SILK OR SATIN, AND, OF COURSE, UNFOLDED ITSELF TO ITS ORIGINAL SHAPE AFTER BEING CRUMPLED UP.

AMONG OTHER MATERIAL, HE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERS A SMALL METALLIC "I-BEAM" WITH PURPLISH "HIEROGLYPHICS."


"GENERAL ROGER M. RAMEY WAS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE ROSWELL INCIDENT, HUT INFORMATION ON HIM IS HARD TO COME BY. EVEN THOUGH HE BECAME A FAIRLY IMPORTANT AIR FORCE GENERAL IN THE EARLY 1950S, FOR SOME REASON THE AIR FORCE BIOGRAPHICAL WEB PAGE ON THEIR GENERALS DOESNT LIST HIM.
RAMEY WAS BORN IN 1903 IN SULPHUR SPRINGS, TEXAS, BUT GREW UP IN DENTON, TEXAS, ABOUT 40 MILES NORTH OF FORT WORTH. HE GRADUATED FROM NORTH TEXAS STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE IN DENTON AND WANTED TO STUDY MEDICINE. BUT HE WON A RODEO COMPETITION AND "PREFERRED WORKING ON A RANCH TO BOOKS."


HE WAS THE MESS SERGEANT IN A LOCAL NATIONAL GUARD UNIT, AND THE CAPTAIN INSISTED YOUNG "COWBOY" RAMEY TAKE THE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION FOR ENTRANCE TO THE U.S. MILITARY ACADEMY, WINNING THE WEST POINT APPOINTMENT. HE ENTERED WEST POINT IN 1924.


JULY 26,1946: RAMEY WROTE ROSWELL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF MAJOR JESSE MARCEL A COMMENDATION FOR HIS WORK DURING CROSSROADS, CITING HIS IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SECURITY, HIS HANDLING OF COMPLEX INTELLIGENCE MATTERS, AND THE PERFECTION OF HIS STAFF BRIEFINGS. A YEAR LATER MARCEL WAS TO HANDLE THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE STRANGE CRASH DEBRIS FOUND BY RANCHER MAC BRAZEL NEAR ROSWELL AND FLY THE DEBRIS TO FORT WORTH FOR EXAMINATION BY GEN. RAMEY.


JUNE 30, 1947: RAMEY AND HIS INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WERE GIVING PRESS INTERVIEWS AND DEBUNKING THE NEW FLYING SAUCER PHENOMENON.


JULY 6, 1947: RAMEY SPENT ALL DAY ATTENDING AN AIR SHOW IN HIS HOME TOWN OF DENTON, TX (AND PROBABLY VISITING RELATIVES). MEANWHILE, BACK IN FORT WORTH WITH RAMEY AWAY FROM THE BASE, HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, BRIG. GEN. THOMAS DUBOSE, SAID HE FIRST LEARNED OF THE FIND AT ROSWELL BY PHONE FROM SA C ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF GEN. MCMULLEN. ACCORDING TO DUBOSE, MCMULLEN ORDERED DEBRIS SAMPLES FLOWN IMMEDIATELY TO WASHINGTON BY "COLONEL COURIER, "FIRST STOPPING IN FORT WORTH. THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE STRICTEST SECRECY, SAID DUBOSE. MCMULLEN ORDERED HIM NOT TO TELL ANYONE, NOT EVEN RAMEY.


JULY 8, 1947: THE INFAMOUS ROSWELL BASE FLYING DISK PRESS RELEASE AND RAMEY'S SUBSEQUENT DEBUNKING OF IT AS A WEATHER BALLOON. ACCORDING TO DUBOSE, MCMULLEN ORDERED THE COVER-UP IN ANOTHER PHONE CALL TO DUBOSE FROM WASHINGTON. BOTH DUBOSE AND ROSWELL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF JESSE MARCEL SAID THE WEATHER BALLOON WAS NOT WHAT MARCEL BROUGHT FROM ROSWELL, BEING NOTHING BUT A COVER STORY TO GET RID OF THE PRESS.

"MOST OF THE TESTIMONY IN THIS (THE FOLLOWING) DOCUMENT IS FROM THE 1992 BOOK "CRASH AT CORONA" BY STANTON FRIEDMAN AND DON BERLINER, PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES BY PARAGON HOUSE. THAT BOOK CONTAINS LOTS OF OTHER INTERESTING MATERIAL, INCLUDING MATERIAL REGARDING ANOTHER CRASH SITE IN NEW MEXICO.


SEQUENCE OF EVENTS:

ON JULY 2, 1947, DURING THE EVENING, A FLYING SAUCER CRASHED ON THE FOSTER RANCH NEAR CORONA, NEW MEXICO. THE CRASH OCCURRED DURING A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM. (THE MILITARY BASE NEAREST THE CRASH SITE IS IN ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO; HENCE, ROSWELL IS MORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT THAN CORONA, EVEN THOUGH CORONA IS CLOSER TO THE CRASH SITE.)
 

ON JULY 3, 1947, WILLIAM "MAC"BRAZEL (RHYMES WITH "FRAZZLE") AND HIS 7-YEAR-OLD NEIGHBOR DEE PROCTOR FOUND THE REMAINS OF THE CRASHED FLYING SAUCER. BRAZEL WAS FOREMAN OF THE FOSTER RANCH. THE PIECES WERE SPREAD OUT OVER A LARGE AREA, PERHAPS MORE THAN HALF A MILE LONG. WHEN BRAZEL DROVE DEE BACK HOME, HE SHOWED A PIECE OF THE WRECKAGE TO DEE'S PARENTS, FLOYD AND LORETTA PROCTOR. THEY ALL AGREED THE PIECE WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER SEEN.
 

ON JULY 6, 1947, BRAZEL SHOWED PIECES OF THE WRECKAGE TO CHAVES COUNTY SHERIFF GEORGE WILCOX. WILCOX CALLED ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD (AAF) AND TALKED TO MAJOR JESSE MARCEL, THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. MARCEL DROVE TO THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND INSPECTED THE WRECKAGE. MARCEL REPORTED TO HIS COMMANDING OFFICER, COLONEL WILLIAM "BUTCH" BLANCHARD. BLANCHARD ORDERED MARCEL TO GET SOMEONE FROM THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS, AND TO PROCEED TO THE RANCH WITH BRAZEL, AND TO COLLECT AS MUCH OF THE WRECKAGE AS THEY COULD LOAD INTO THEIR TWO VEHICLES.
 

SOON AFTER THIS, MILITARY POLICE ARRIVED AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE, COLLECTED THE WRECKAGE BRAZEL HAD LEFT THERE, AND DELIVERED THE WRECKAGE TO BLANCHARD'S OFFICE. THE WRECKAGE WAS THEN FLOWN TO EIGHTH AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS IN FORT WORTH, AND FROM THERE TO WASHINGTON.
MEANWHILE, MARCEL AND SHERIDAN CAVITT OF THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE CORPS DROVE TO THE RANCH WITH MAC BRAZEL. THEY ARRIVED LATE IN THE EVENING. THEY SPENT THE NIGHT IN SLEEPING HAGS IN A SMALL OUT-BUILDING ON THE RANCH, AND IN THE MORNING PROCEEDED TO THE CRASH SITE.
 

ON JULY 7, 1947, MARCEL AND CAVITT COLLECTED WRECKAGE FROM THE CRASH SITE. AFTER FILLING CAVITT'S VEHICLE WITH WRECKAGE, MARCEL TOLD CAVITT TO GO ON AHEAD, THAT MARCEL WOULD COLLECT MORE WRECKAGE, AND THEY WOULD MEET LATER BACK AT ROSWELL AAF. MARCEL FILLED HIS VEHICLE
WITH WRECKAGE. ON THE WAY HACK TO THE AIR FIELD, MARCEL STOPPED AT HOME TO SHOW HIS WIFE AND SON THE STRANGE MATERIAL HE HAD FOUND.
 

ON JULY 7, 1947, AROUND 4:00 PM, LYDIA SLEPPY AT ROSWELL RADIO STATION KSWS BEGAN TRANSMITTING A STORY ON THE TELETYPE MACHINE REGARDING A CRASHED FLYING SAUCER OUT ON THE FOSTER RANCH. TRANSMISSION WAS INTERRUPTED, SEEMINGLY BY THE FBI.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, IN THE MORNING, MARCEL AND CAVITT AMVED BACK AT ROSWELL AAF WITH TWO CARLOADS OF WRECKAGE. MARCEL ACCOMPANIED THIS WRECKAGE, OR MOST IT, ON A FLIGHT TO FORT WORTH AAF.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, AROUND NOON, COLONEL BLANCHARD AT ROSWELL AAF ORDERED SECOND LIEUTENANT WALTER HAUT TO ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE TELLING THE COUNTRY THAT THE ARMY HAD FOUND THE REMAINS OF A CRASHED A FLYING SAUCER. HAUT WAS THE PUBLIC INFBRMATHN OFFICER FOR THE 509TH BOMB GROUP AT ROSWELL AAF. HAUT DELIVERED THE PRESS RELEASE TO FRANK JOYCE AT RADIO STATION KGFL. JOYCE WAITED LONG ENOUGH FOR HAUT TO RETURN TO THE BASE, THEN CALLED HAUT THERE TO CONFINN THE STORY. JOYCE THEN SENT THE STORY ON THE WESTERN UNION WIRE TO THE UNITED PRESS BUREAU.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, IN THE AFTERNOON, GENERAL CLEMENCE MCMULLEN IN WASHINGTON SPOKE BY TELEPHONE WITH COLONEL (LATER BRIGADIER GENERAL) THOMAS DUBOSE IN FORT WORTH, CHIEF OF STAFF TO EIGHTH AIR FORCE COMMANDER GENERAL ROGER RAMEY. MCMULLEN ORDERED DUBOSE TO TELL RAMEY TO QUASH THE FLYING SAUCER STORY BY CREATING A COVER STORY, AND TO SEND SOME OF THE CRASH MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY TO WASHINGTON.
 

ON JULY 8, 1947, IN THE AFTERNOON, GENERAL ROGER RAMEY HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE AT EIGHTH AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS IN FORT WORTH IN WHICH HE ANNOUNCED THAT WHAT HAD CRASHED AT CORONA WAS A WEATHER BALLOON, NOT A FLYING SAUCER. TO MAKE THIS STORY CONVINCING, HE SHOWED THE PRESS THE REMAINS OF A DAMAGED WEATHER BALLOON THAT HE CLAIMED WAS THE ACTUAL WRECKAGE FROM THE CRASH SITE. (APPARENTLY, THE OBLIGING PRESS DID NOT ASK WHY THE ARMY HURRIEDLY TRANSPORTED WEATHER BALLOON WRECKAGE TO FORT WORTH, TEXAS, SITE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE, FROM THE CRASH SITE IN A REMOTE AREA OF NEW MEXICO.)

THE ONLY NEWSPAPERS THAT CARRIED THE INITIAL FLYING SAUCER VERSION OF THE STORY WERE EVENING PAPERS FROM THE MIDWEST TO THE WEST, INCLUDING THE CHICAGO DAILY NEWS, THE LOS ANGELES HERALD EXPRESS, THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER, AND THE ROSWELL DAILY RECORD. THE NEW YORK TIMES, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE WERE MORNING PAPERS AND SO CARRIED ONLY THE COVER-UP STORY THE NEXT MORNING.


AT SOME POINT, A LARGE GROUP OF SOLDIERS WERE SENT TO THE DEBRIS FIELD ON THE FOSTER RANCH, INCLUDING A LOT OF MPS WHOSE JOB WAS TO LIMIT ACCESS TO THE FIELD. A WIDE SEARCH WAS LAUNCHED WELL BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DEBRIS FIELD. WITHIN A DAY OR TWO, A FEW MILES FROM THE DEBRIS FIELD, THE MAIN BODY OF THE FLYING SAUCER WAS FOUND, AND A MILE OR TWO FROM THAT SEVERAL BODIES OF SMALL HUMANOIDS WERE FOUND.


THE MILITARY TOOK MAC BRAZEL INTO CUSTODY FOR ABOUT A WEEK, DURING WHICH TIME HE WAS SEEN ON THE STREETS OF ROSWELL WITH A MILITARY ESCORT. HIS BEHAVIOR AROUSED THE CURIOSITY OF FRIENDS WHEN HE PASSED THEM WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF RECOGNITION. FOLLOWING THIS PERIOD OF DETENTION, BRAZEL REPUDIATED HIS INITIAL STORY."

19"...I DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE PERSONNEL ON BOARD THE CRAFT HAD SURVIVED THE CRASH..."
THE FOLLOWING IS A VERBATIM COPY OF THE SIGNED AFFIDAVIT SUBMITTED ON 8-7-1991 BY GLENN DENNIS, A MORTICIAN, IN ROSWELL, N.M. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT DESCRIBED IN THE LETTER FROM MRS. MACELROY:

(PLEASE NOTE: MRS. MACELROY IS NOT THE SAME NURSE THAT MR. DENNIS MENTIONS IN HIS AFFIDAVIT. ALTHOUGH NO OFFICIAL IDENTIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE, SEVERAL WITNESSES HAVE IDENTIFIED "NURSE X" AS 1ST LT. ADELINE "EILEEN" FANTON.)

"AFFIDAVIT OF GLENN DENNIS
(1) MY NAME IS GLENN DENNIS
 

(2) MY ADDRESS IS: XXXXXXXXXX
 

(3) I AM () EMPLOYED AS: () RETIRED,
 

(4) IN JULY 1947, I WAS A MORTICIAN, WORKING FOR THE BALLARD FUNERAL HOME IN ROSWELL, WHICH HAD A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE MORTUARY SERVICES FOR THE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD. ONE AFTERNOON, AROUND 1:15 OR 1:30,1 RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE BASE MORTUARY OFFICER WHO ASKED WHAT WAS THE SMALLEST SIZE HERMETICALLY SEALED CASKET THAT WE HAD IN STOCK. HE SAID, "WE NEED TO KNOW THIS IN CASE SOMETHING COMES UP IN THE FUTURE." HE ASKED HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET ONE, AND I ASSURED HIM I COULD GET ONE FOR HIM THE FOLLOWING DAY. HE SAID HE WOULD CALL BACK IF THEY NEEDED ONE.
 

(5) ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR LATER, HE CALLED BACK AND ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE THE PREPARATION FOR BODIES THAT HAD BEEN LYING OUT ON THE DESERT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. BEFORE I COULD ANSWER, HE SAID HE SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT EFFECT THE PREPARATION PROCEDURES WOULD HAVE ON THE BODY'S CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, BLOOD AND TISSUES. I EXPLAINED THAT OUR CHEMICALS WERE MAINLY STRONG SOLUTIONS OF FORMALDEHYDE AND WATER, AND THAT THE PROCEDURE WOULD PROBABLY ALTER THE BODY'S CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. I OFFERED TO COME OUT TO THE BASE TO ASSIST WITH ANY PROBLEM HE MIGHT HAVE, BUT HE REITERATED THAT THE INFOMIATION WAS FOR FUTURE USE. I SUGGESTED THAT IF HE HAD SUCH A SITUATION THAT I WOULD TRY TO FREEZE THE BODY IN DRY ICE FOR STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION.
 

(6) APPROXIMATELY A HOUR OR AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES LATER, I GOT A CALL TO TRANSPORT A SERVICEMAN WHO HAD A LACERATION ON HIS HEAD AND PERHAPS A FRACTURED NOSE. I GAVE HIM FIRST AID AND DROVE HIM OUT TO THE BASE. I GOT THERE AROUND 5:00 PM.
 

(7) ALTHOUGH I WAS A CIVILIAN, I USUALLY HAD FREE ACCESS ON THE BASE BECAUSE THEY KNEW ME.
I DROVE THE AMBULANCE AROUND TO THE BACK OF THE BASE INFIRMARY AND PARKED IT NEXT TO ANOTHER AMBULANCE. THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND INSIDE I SAW SOME WRECKAGE. THERE WERE SEVERAL PIECES WHICH LOOKED LIKE THE BOTTOM OF A CANOE, ABOUT THREE FEET IN LENGTH. IT RESEMBLED STAINLESS STEEL WITH A PURPLE HUE, AS IF IT HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE. THERE WAS SOME STRANGE-LOOKING WRITING ON THE MATERIAL RESEMBLING EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS. ALSO THERE WERE TWO MPS PRESENT.
 

(8) I CHECKED THE AIRMAN IN AND WENT TO THE STAFF LOUNGE TO HAVE A COKE. I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR A NURSE, A 2ND LIEUTENANT, WHO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED ABOUT THREE MONTHS EARLIER RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE. SHE WAS 23 YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME (I WAS 22). I SAW HER COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE EXAMINING ROOMS WITH A CLOTH OVER HER MOUTH. SHE SAID, "MY GOSH, GET OUT OF HERE OR YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE." SHE WENT INTO ANOTHER DOOR WHERE A CAPTAIN STOOD. HE ASKED ME WHO I WAS AND WHAT I WAS DOING HERE. I TOLD HIM, AND HE INSTRUCTED ME TO STAY THERE. I SAID, "IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A CRASH; WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GET READY?" HE TOLD ME TO STAY RIGHT THERE. THEN TWO MPS CAME UP AND BEGAN TO ESCORT ME OUT OF THE INFIRMARY. THEY SAID THEY HAD ORDERS TO FOLLOW ME OUT TO THE FUNERAL HOME.
 

(9) WE GOT ABOUT 10 OR 15 FEET WHEN I HEARD A VOICE SAY, "WE'RE NOT THROUGH WITH THAT SOB.
BRING HIM BACK." THERE WAS ANOTHER CAPTAIN, A REDHEAD WITH THE MEANEST-LOOKING EYES I HAD EVER SEEN, WHO SAID, "YOU DID NOT SEE ANYTHING, THERE WAS NO CRASH HERE, AND IF YOU SAY ANYTHING YOU COULD GET INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE." I SAID, "HEY LOOK MISTER, I'M A CIVILIAN AND YOU CAN'T DO A DAMN THING TO ME." HE SAID, "YES WE CAN; SOMEBODY WILL BE PICKING YOUR BONES OUT OF THE SAND." THERE WAS A BLACK SERGEANT WITH A PAD IN HIS HAND WHO SAID, "HE WOULD MAKE GOOD DOG FOOD FOR OUR DOGS." THE CAPTAIN SAID, "GET THE SOB OUT." THE MPS FOLLOWED ME BACK TO THE FUNERAL HOME.
 

(10) THE NEXT DAY, I TRIED TO CALL THE NURSE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. ABOUT 11:00 AM, SHE CALLED THE FUNERAL HOME AND SAID, "I NEED TO TALK TO YOU." WE AGREED TO MEET AT THE OFFICERS CLUB. SHE WAS VERY UPSET. SHE SAID, "BEFORE I TALK TO YOU, YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A SACRED OATH THAT YOU WILL NEVER MENTION MY NAME, BECAUSE I COULD GET INTO A TOR OF TROUBLE." I AGREED.
 

(11) SHE SAID SHE HAD GONE TO GET SUPPLIES IN A ROOM WHERE TWO DOCTORS WERE PERFORMING A PRELIMARY AUTOPSY. THE DOCTORS SAID THEY NEEDED HER TO TAKE NOTES DURING THE PROCEDURE. SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER SMELLED ANYTHING SO HORRIBLE IN HER LIFE, AND THE SIGHT WAS THE MOST GRUESOME SHE HAD EVER SEEN. SHE SAID, "THIS WAS SOMETHING NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN." AS SHE SPOKE, I WAS CONCERNED THAT SHE MIGHT GO INTO SHOCK.
 

(12) SHE DREW ME A DIAGRAM OF THE BODIES, INCLUDING AN ARM WITH A HAND THAT HAD ONLY FOUR FINGERS; THE DOCTORS NOTED THAT ON THE END OF THE FINGERS WERE LITTLE PADS RESEMBLING SUCTION CUPS. SHE SAID THE HEAD WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE FOR THE BODY; THE EYES WERE DEEPLY SET; THE SKULLS WERE FLEXIBLE; THE NOSE WAS CONCAVE WITH ONLY TWO ORIFICES; THE MOUTH WAS A FINE SLIT, AND THE DOCTORS SAID THERE WAS HEAVY CARTILAGE INSTEAD OF TEETH. THE EARS WERE ONLY SMALL ORIFICES WITH FLAPS. THEY HAD NO HAIR, AND THE SKIN WAS BLACK-PE&IAPS DUE TO EXPOSURE IN THE SUN. SHE GAVE ME THE DRAWINGS.
 

(13) THERE WERE THREE BODIES; TWO WERE VERY MANGLED AND DISMEMBERED, AS IF DESTROYED BY PREDATORS; ONE WAS FAIRLY INTACT. THEY WERE THREE-AND-A-HALF TO FOUR FEET TALL. SHE TOLD ME THE DOCTORS SAID: "THIS ISN'T ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEE BEFORE; THERE'S NOTHING IN THE MEDICAL TEXTBOOKS LIKE THIS." SHE SAID SHE AND THE DOCTORS BECAME ILL. THEY HAD TO TURN OFF THE AIR CONDITIONING AND WERE AFRAID THE SMELL WOULD GO THROUGH THE HOSPITAL. THEY HAD TO MOVE THE OPERATION TO AN AIRPLANE HANGAR.
 

(14) I DROVE HER BACK TO THE OFFICERS' BARRACKS. THE NEXT DAY I CALLED THE HOSPITAL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS, AND THEY SAID SHE WASN'T AVAILABLE. I TRIED TO GET HER FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AND FINALLY GOT ONE OF THE NURSES WHO SAID THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN TRANSFENED OUT WITH SOME OTHER PERSONNEL. ABOUT 10 DAYS TO TWO WEEKS LATER, I GOT A LETTER FROM HER WITH AN APO NUMBER. SHE INDICATED WE COULD DISCUSS THE INCIDENT BY LETTER IN THE FUTURE. I WROTE BACK TO HER AND ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER THE LETTER CAME BACK MARKED "RETURN TO SENDER-DECEASED." LATER ONE OF THE NURSES AT THE BASE SAID THE RUMOR WAS THAT SHE AND FIVE OTHER NURSES HAD BEEN ON A TRAINING MISSION AND HAD BEEN KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH.
 

(15) SHERIFF GEORGE WILCOX AND MY FATHER WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS. THE SHERIFF WENT TO MY FOLKS' HOUSE THE MORNING AFTER THE EVENTS AT THE BASE AND SAID TO MY FATHER, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE GLENN'S IN, BUT YOU TELL YOUR SON THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING AND
HASN'T SEEN ANYTHING AT THE BASE." HE ADDED, "THEY WANT YOU AND YOUR WIFE'S NAME, AND THEY WANT YOUR AND YOUR CHILDREN'S ADDRESSES." MY FATHER IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO THE FUNERAL HOME AND ASKED ME WHAT KIND OF
TROUBLE I WAS IN. HE RELATED THE CONVERSATION WITH SHERIFF WILCOX, AND SO I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY. HE IS THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM I HAVE TOLD THIS STORY UNTIL RECENTLY.
 

(16) I HAD FILED AWAY THE SKETCHES THE NURSE GAVE ME THAT DAY. RECENTLY, AT THE REQUEST OF A RESEARCHER, I TRIED TO LOCATE MY PERSONAL FILES AT THE FUNERAL HOME, BUT THEY HAD ALL BEEN DESTROYED.
 

(17) I HAVE NOT BEEN PAID OR GIVEN ANYTHING OF VALUE TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT, WHICH IS THE TRUTH TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION.

20 "...TELEPATHIC THOUGHT..."
"TELEPATHY, FROM THE GREEK TEAE, TELE MEANING "REMOTE" AND ΠΆΘΕΙΑ, PATHEIA MEANING "TO BE AFFECTED BY", DESCRIBES THE PURPORTED TRANSFER OF INFORMATION ON THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BY MEANS OTHER THAN THE FIVE CLASSICAL SENSES. THE TERM WAS COINED IN 1882 BY THE CLASSICAL SCHOLAR FREDRIC W. H. MYERS, A FOUNDER OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH, SPECIFICALLY TO REPLACE THE EARLIER EXPRESSION THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE. A PERSON WHO IS ABLE TO MAKE USE OF TELEPATHY IS SAID TO BE ABLE TO READ THE MINDS OF OTHERS. TELEPATHY, ALONG WITH PSYCHOKINESIS FORMS THE MAIN BRANCHES OF PARAPSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AND MANY STUDIES SEEKING TO DETECT AND UNDERSTAND TELEPATHY HAVE BEEN DONE WITHIN THE FIELD.


TELEPATHY IS A COMMON THEME IN FICTION AND SCIENCE FICTION, WITH MANY SUPERHEROES AND SUPERVILLAINS HAVING TELEPATHIC ABILITIES. SUCH ABILITIES INCLUDE BOTH SENSING THE THOUGHTS OF OTHERS, AND CONTROLLING THE MINDS OF OTHER PEOPLE. TRANSHUMANISTS BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGICALLY ENABLED TELEPATHY, CALLED "TECHLEPATHY", WILL BE THE INEVITABLE FUTURE OF HUMANITY, AND SEEK TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL, SAFE DEVICES FOR DIRECTLY CONNECTING HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEMS."

21 "...I WAS THE ONLY WOMEN AT THE SITE..."
"ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE ALIEN BODIES AND A VANISHING NURSE CAME FROM PETE AND RUBEN ANAYA, WHO SAID THEY PICKED UP N.M. LT. GOVERNOR JOSEPH MONTOYA OUTSIDE THE LARGE BASE HANGAR. BESIDES THE HANGAR BEING HEAVILY GUARDED BY MPS, THEY SAID THERE WAS A BASE NURSE (OR MAYBE TWO DIFFERENT NURSES) WHO CAME OUTSIDE THE HANGAR AND SPOKE BRIEFLY WITH THEM. RUBEN SAID SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE BODIES WERE "NOT FROM THIS WORLD" AND THEN NOTICED ONE OF THEM MOVING. RUBEN SAID HE THEN WENT TO TAKE A LOOK AND ALSO GLIMPSED TWO SMALL BODIES FROM A DISTANCE UNDER SHEETS INSIDE THE HANGAR AND ONE OF THEM MOVING. HE DESCRIBED THE NURSE HE SPOKE TO AS BLONDISH AND HEAVYSET. [NOTE: OF THE FIVE NURSES THAT ARE PICTURED IN THE BASE YEARBOOK FROM AROUND JUNE/JULY 1947, NONE OF THEM APPEAR BLONDISH OR HEAVYSET, THOUGH.

IN CONTRAST, PETE ANAYA SAID HE KNEW THE NURSE HE SPOKE TO FROM THE OFFICER'S CLUB (HIS BROTHER RUBEN WORKED THERE AS A COOK), HAD DANCED WITH HER ONCE THE PREVIOUS HALLOWEEN AT A PARTY, SAID SHE RESEMBLED HIS WIFE MARY, AND WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WITH BEAUTIFUL HAIR. HE WANTED TO GO INSIDE THE HANGAR TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND SHE TOLD HIM HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING. AFTER THAT, HE SAID HE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN. (SOURCE: TIM SHAWCROSS, THE ROSWELL FILE, 1997)


FORMER ROSWELL POLICE CHIEF LM. HAFT REMEMBERED DENNIS TELLING HIM ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER THE NEWSPAPER STORIES OF THE CRASHED FLYING SAUCER, ABOUT STRANGE CALLS FROM THE BASE FOR CHILD-SIZE CASKETS "TO SHIP OR BURY THOSE ALIENS."


ANOTHER WITNESS THAT RECENTLY CAME FORTH TO CORROBORATE PARTS OF DENNIS' STORY WAS S/SQT. MILTON SPROUSE. THEN A B-29 CREW CHIEF WITH THE 830TH BOMB SQUADRON. SPROUSE SAID HE SPOKE TO DENNIS SEVERAL YEARS LATER WHILE DENNIS HANDLED A FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND. DENNIS TOLD HIM HE HAD RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE BASE FOR FIVE CHILDREN'S CASKETS FOR A CRASH THAT HAD HAPPENED 2 OR 3 DAYS BEFORE. THUS IT SEEMS THAT DENNIS' STORY OF THE CHILD CASKET CALL IS NOT OF RECENT ORIGIN HUT DATES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL EVENT ITSELF.


SPROUSE SAID THE BODIES WERE TAKEN TO A HANGAR HEAVILY GUARDED BY MPS WITH MACHINE GUNS. HE ALSO SAID HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THE AUTOPSY INITIALLY DESCRIBED BY DENNIS. A FELLOW STAFF SERGEANT IN HIS BARRACKS, WHO WORKED AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM MEDIC AT THE BASE HOSPITAL, WAS CALLED OUT THERE. WHEN HE CAME BACK HE RELATED THAT AN AUTOPSY ON ONE OR TWO OF THE "HUMANOID BODIES" HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT BY TWO DOCTORS AND TWO NURSES. HIS FRIEND SAID HE HAD SEEN THE BODIES. SIMILAR TO DENNIS' NURSE, THE SERGEANT WAS TRANSFERRED THE FOLLOWING DAY AND NOBODY EVER FOUND OUT WHAT BECAME OF HIM.


SPROUSE ALSO HEARD THAT THE DOCTORS AND NURSES INVOLVED WITH THE AUTOPSY WERE ALSO TRANSFERRED AND NOBODY FOUND OUT WHAT BECAME OF THEM EITHER. FIVE MEMBERS OF HIS GROUND CREW WERE ALSO SENT TO THE RANCH TO HELP CLEAN UP THE DEBRIS FIELD. THEY TOLD HIM THE MATERIAL WAS "OUT OF THIS WORLD," INCLUDING FOIL THAT WHEN CRUMPLED RETURNED TO IFS ORIGINAL SHAPE."
