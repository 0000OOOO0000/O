POST SCRIPT FROM MRS. MACELROY

 

EDITOR' NOTE:

THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WAS ENCLOSED IN A SEPARATE ENVELOPE MARKED "READ ME LAST", TOGETHER WITH THE ORIGINAL LETTER, THE TRANSCRIPTS AND THE OTHER NOTES OF EXPLANATION I RECEIVED IN THE ENVELOPE FROM MRS. MACELROY.

 

THIS IS WHAT THE MESSAGE SAID:


"THE OTHER DOCUMENTS IN THIS ENVELOPE ARE THE END OF THE STORY, AS FAR AS WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN 1947. HOWEVER, SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT GOT ME SETTLED AT MY FINAL RELOCATION DESTINATION, I CONTINUED MY COMMUNICATION WITH AIRL ON A REGULAR BASIS.


IT HAS BEEN ALMOST EXACTLY 40 YEARS SINCE THE CRASH AT ROSWELL. SINCE THEN IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY WITH AIRL FOR ONE REASON: I AM ONE OF THE 3,000 MEMBERS OF THE LOST BATTALION. AT THIS TIME, ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE LOST BATTALION HAVE BEEN LOCATED ON EARTH AS A RESULT OF THE DOMAIN ANUNNAKI MISSION AND THEIR USE OF THE "TREE OF LIFE" DETECTION DEVICE.


THROUGH MY COMMUNICATION WITH AIRL, I HAVE RECOVERED SOME OF MY MEMORY OF LIVES I'VE SPENT ON EARTH OVER THE PAST 8,000 YEARS. MOST OF THESE MEMORIES ARE NOT ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT COMPARED TO THE LONG BACKTRACK OF EVENTS, BUT IT HAS BEEN A NECESSARY STEPPING STONE TO REGAINING MY AWARENESS AND ABILITY AS AN IS-BE.


I CAN ALSO REMEMBER SOME DIM PATCHES OF MY LIFE IN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE. I WAS A NURSE THERE TOO. FOR THE MOST PART I'VE BEEN A NURSE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN DOWN THROUGH THE AGES. I STICK WITH BEING A NURSE BECAUSE IT IS FAMILIAR TO ME. AND, I ENJOY THE WORK OF HELPING PEOPLE, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE RACE OF BIOLOGICAL BEINGS IN THE DOMAIN WHOSE BODIES LOOK MORE LIKE INSECTS THAN MAMMALS, ESPECIALLY THEIR HANDS. EVEN DOLL BODIES NEED SOME REPAIR ONCE IN AWHILE, TOO.


AS I REMEMBER MORE ABOUT MY PAST, I REALIZE THAT THE REST OF MY LIFE IS IN THE FUTURE. ETERNITY IS NOT JUST IN THE PAST. ETERNITY IS IN THE FUTURE. AT
THIS POINT I AM STILL NOT ABLE TO FULLY RETURN TO THE DOMAIN. I AM SENTENCED TO ETERNAL IMPRISONMENT, LIKE ALL OTHER IS-BES IN THE LIVING HELL CALLED EARTH, UNTIL WE CAN DISABLE THE "OLD EMPIRE" FORCE SCREENS.


BECAUSE I WON'T KEEP MY BIOLOGICAL BODY MUCH LONGER NOW, I AM INTENSELY AWARE THAT VERY SOON I WILL BE RECYCLED THROUGH THE AMNESIA PROCESS OF THE "OLD EMPIRE", AND STUCK BACK INTO ANOTHER BABY BODY TO START ALL OVER AGAIN - WITHOUT ANY MEMORY OF WHAT WENT BEFORE.


AS YOU KNOW, MEMBERS OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. AIRL SAYS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE DOMAIN HAS LOCATED ALL OF THE LOST BATTALION OFFICERS AND CREW, THE SUCCESS OF FREEING THEM DEPENDS ON THE IS-BES WHO ARE ALREADY ON EARTH. THE DOMAIN CENTRAL COMMAND CANNOT AUTHORIZE ANY PERSONNEL OR RESOURCES, AT THIS TIME, TO CONDUCT A "RESCUE MISSION" AS THIS IN NOT THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE IN THIS GALAXY.


SO, IF IS-BES ON EARTH ARE GOING TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PRISON, IT WILL HAVE TO BE AN "INSIDE JOB", SO TO SPEAK. THE INMATES WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEMSELVES OUT. VARIOUS METHODS OF RECOVERING THE MEMORY AND ABILITY OF IS-BES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST 10,000 YEARS ON EARTH, BUT NONE HAVE PROVEN TO BE CONSISTENTLY EFFECTIVE SO FAR.


AIRL MENTIONED THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH WAS MADE BY GAUTAMA SIDDHARTHA ABOUT 2,500 YEARS AGO. HOWEVER, THE ORIGINAL TEACHINGS AND TECHNIQUES TAUGHT BY THE BUDDHA HAVE BEEN ALTERED OR LOST OVER THE MILLENNIA SINCE THEN. THE PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES OF HIS PHILOSOPHY WERE PERVERTED INTO ROBOTIC RELIGIOUS RITUALS BY PRIESTS AS A SELF-SERVING INSTRUMENT OF CONTROL OR SLAVERY.


HOWEVER, ANOTHER MAJOR ADVANCE OCCURRED RECENTLY. AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE SPACE STATION IS AN IS-BE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN AN IMPORTANT ENGINEER AND OFFICER IN THE "OLD EMPIRE" SPACE FLEET. HE BECOME AN "UNTOUCHABLE" HIMSELF ABOUT 10,000 YEARS AGO AND WAS SENTENCED TO EARTH FOR LEADING A MUTINY AGAINST THE OPPRESSIVE REGIME OF THE "OLD EMPIRE". THE ENGINEER WAS TRAINED IN ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC IMPROVISATION THEORY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. THIS MAN HAS APPLIED HIS EXPERTISE TO HELPING THE DOMAIN SOLVE THE APPARENTLY UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM OF RESCUING THE MEMBERS OF THE LOST BATTALION, AS WELL AS THE IS-BES ON EARTH.


CAREFUL OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE MECHANICS OF MEMORY IN IS-BES BY HE AND HIS WIFE, WHO ASSISTED HIM, LED TO THE REALIZATION THAT IS-BES CAN RECOVER FROM AMNESIA AND ALSO REGAIN LOST ABILITIES. TOGETHER THEY DISCOVERED AND DEVELOPED EFFECTIVE METHODS THAT THEY USED TO REHABILITATE THEIR OWN MEMORIES. THEY EVENTUALLY CODIFIED THEIR METHODS SO THAT OTHERS CAN SAFELY BE TRAINED TO APPLY THEM TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS, WITHOUT DETECTION BY THE "OLD EMPIRE" THOUGHT CONTROL OPERATORS.


THEIR RESEARCH ALSO REVEALED THAT IS-BES CAN OCCUPY AND OPERATE MORE THAN ONE BODY AT THE SAME TIME -A FACT THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS THOUGHT TO BE UNIQUELY LIMITED TO OFFICERS OF THE DOMAIN.


ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS FACT IS THAT THE ENGINEER, IN A PREVIOUS LIFETIME ON EARTH, WAS SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 241 (FOOTNOTE). HIS ASSISTANT WAS A HAREM GIRL WHO ROSE UP FROM SLAVERY TO BECOME HIS WIFE AND RULE THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WITH HIM. 242 (FOOTNOTE) SIMULTANEOUSLY, SHE INHABITED ANOTHER BODY AND RULED HER OWN EMPIRE AS QUEEN ELIZABETH. 243 (FOOTNOTE) AS THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND, SHE NEVER MARRIED, BECAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED TO THE SULTAN OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE!


IN A LATER LIFE HE WAS INCARNATED AS CECIL RHODES. 244 (FOOTNOTE). DURING HIS LIFE AS RHODES SHE WAS, AGAIN, A PRINCESS, THIS TIME FROM POLAND. 245 (FOOTNOTE) AS SUCH, SHE PURSUED RHODES UNSUCCESSFULLY TOWARD THE END OF HIS LIFE. HOWEVER, IN THEIR NEXT INCARNATION THEY MET AGAIN, WERE MARRIED, HAD A FAMILY, AND AGAIN, WORKED TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY ALL OF THEIR LIVES.


SEVERAL OTHER NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF THIS PHENOMENA WERE OBSERVED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROCESS OF REFINING STEEL WAS INVENTED BY THE SAME IS-BE WHO INHABITED TWO BODIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. ONE WAS NAMED KELLY 246 (FOOTNOTE) WHO LIVED IN KENTUCKY, AND THE OTHER WAS A MAN NAMED BESSEMER (FOOTNOTE) WHO LIVED IN ENGLAND. THEY BOTH CONCEIVED THE SAME PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME.


ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL 248 (FOOTNOTE) THE INVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE, WHICH WAS INVENTED BY SEVERAL OTHERS AT THE SAME TIME, INCLUDING ELISHA GRAY. 249 (FOOTNOTE) THE TELEPHONE WAS CONCEIVED CONCURRENTLY IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ALL AT ONCE. THIS WAS A SINGLE IS-BE OF SUCH TREMENDOUS ENERGY AND ABILITY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OPERATE SEVERAL BODIES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHILE CONDUCTING COMPLEX RESEARCH WORK!


THANKS TO THESE REVELATIONS, THE DOMAIN HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETURN SOME OF IS-BES OF THE LOST BATTALION TO ACTIVE DUTY ON A LIMITED, PART-TIME BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO YOUNG GIRLS WHO OCCUPY BIOLOGICAL BODIES ON EARTH ARE NOW, AT THE SAME TIME, WORKING AS ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE ON THE ASTEROID SPACE STATION AS OPERATORS OF A COMMUNICATION SWITCHBOARD. THESE OPERATORS RELAY MESSAGES BETWEEN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THE DOMAIN COMMAND HEADQUARTERS.


RECENTLY, I, MYSELF HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESUME SOME OF MY OWN DUTIES FOR THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WHILE CONTINUING TO LIVE ON EARTH. THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK HOWEVER, AND CAN ONLY BE DONE WHILE MY BIOLOGICAL BODY IS SLEEPING.


IT MAKES ME VERY, VERY HAPPY TO KNOW THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE TO STAY ON EARTH FOREVER! THERE IS HOPE OF ESCAPE, NOT JUST FOR THE LOST BATTALION, BUT FOR MANY OTHER IS-BES ON EARTH.


HOWEVER, ALL IS-BES COULD BE HELPED TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE ACTUAL SITUATION ON EARTH THROUGH THE INFORMATION IN THIS ENVELOPE. THIS IS WHY I SENT THESE LETTERS AND TRANSCRIPTS TO YOU. I WANT YOU TO GET THESE DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED. I WANT IS-BES ON EARTH TO HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING ON EARTH.


MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE ANY OF IT, I'M SURE. IT SEEMS TOO INCREDIBLE. NO "REASONABLE" PERSON WOULD EVER BELIEVE A WORD OF IT. HOWEVER, IT ONLY SEEMS "INCREDIBLE" TO AN IS-BE WHOSE MEMORY HAS BEEN ERASED AND REPLACED WITH FALSE INFORMATION INSIDE THE ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED ILLUSION OF A PRISON PLANET. WE MUST NOT ALLOW THE APPARENT INCREDIBILITY OF OUR SITUATION TO PREVENT US FROM CONFRONTING THE REALITY OF IT.


FRANKLY, "REASONS" HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. THERE ARE NO REASONS. THINGS ARE WHAT THEY ARE. IF WE DON'T FACE THE FACTS OF OUR SITUATION, WE'RE GOING TO STAY UNDER THE THUMB OF THE "OLD EMPIRE" FOREVER! THE BIGGEST WEAPON THE "OLD EMPIRE" HAS LEFT NOW IS OUR IGNORANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO ALL THE IS-BES ON EARTH. DISBELIEF AND SECRECY ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS THEY HAVE!


THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT CLASSIFIED THE ENCLOSED TRANSCRIPTS AS "TOP SECRET" ARE RUN BY IS-BES WHO ARE NOTHING MORE THAN MINDLESS AUTOMATONS COVERTLY ORDERED ABOUT THROUGH HYPNOTIC COMMANDS GIVEN BY THE "OLD EMPIRE" PRISON OPERATORS. THEY ARE THE UNKNOWING SLAVES OF UNSEEN SLAVE MASTERS - AND ALL THE MORE ENSLAVED BY THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BE SLAVES.


MOST OF THE IS-BES ON EARTH ARE GOOD, HONEST, ABLE BEINGS: ARTISTS, MANAGERS, GENIUSES, FREE THINKERS AND REVOLUTIONARIES WHO HAVE HARMED NO ONE, REALLY. THEY ARE NO THREAT TO ANYONE EXCEPT THE CRIMINALS WHO HAVE IMPRISONED THEM.


THEY MUST FIND OUT ABOUT THE "OLD EMPIRE" AMNESIA AND HYPNOSIS OPERATION. THEY MUST REMEMBER THEIR OWN PAST LIVES. THE ONLY WAY THIS WILL EVER HAPPEN IS TO COMMUNICATE, COORDINATE AND FIGHT BACK. WE HAVE TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE TO DISCUSS IT OPENLY WITH EACH OTHER. COMMUNICATION IS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST SECRECY AND OPPRESSION.


THIS IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO TELL THIS STORY. PLEASE SHARE THESE TRANSCRIPTS WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN. IF THE PEOPLE OF EARTH ARE TOLD WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE, PERHAPS THEY WILL BEGIN TO REMEMBER WHO THEY ARE, AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM.


FOR NOW, WE CAN BEGIN OUR OWN RELEASE AND RESCUE WITH WORDS. WE CAN BE FREE AGAIN. WE CAN BE OURSELVES AGAIN.

 

PERHAPS I WILL MEET YOU IN PERSON, WITH OR WITHOUT A BODY, SOMEWHERE IN OUR ETERNAL FUTURE.

GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US,

MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY

241 "... SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT... "
"SULEIMAN I (OTTOMAN TURKISH: SULAYMAN, TURKISH: SULEYMAN; ALMOST ALWAYS KANUNI SULTAN SULEYMAN IN TURKISH) (NOVEMBER 6, 1494 - SEPTEMBER 5/6, 1566), WAS THE TENTH AND LONGEST-REIGNING SULTAN OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, FROM 1520 TO HIS DEATH IN 1566. HE IS KNOWN IN THE WEST AS SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT AND IN THE EAST, AS THE LAWGIVER (IN TURKISH KANUNI; ARABIC: , AL - QANUNT), FOR HIS COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE OTTOMAN LEGAL SYSTEM. SULEIMAN BECAME THE PRE-EMINENT MONARCH OF 16TH CENTURY EUROPE, PRESIDING OVER THE APEX OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE'S MILITARY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER.

 

SULEIMAN PERSONALLY LED OTTOMAN ARMIES TO CONQUER THE CHRISTIAN STRONGHOLDS OF BELGRADE, RHODES, AND MOST OF HUNGARY BEFORE HIS CONQUESTS WERE CHECKED AT THE SIEGE OF VIENNA IN 1529. HE ANNEXED MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN HIS CONFLICT WITH THE PERSIANS AND LARGE SWATHES OF NORTH AFRICA AS FAR WEST AS ALGERIA. UNDER HIS RULE, THE OTTOMAN FLEET DOMINATED THE SEAS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDIAN OCEAN.
 

AT THE HELM OF AN EXPANDING EMPIRE, SULEIMAN PERSONALLY INSTITUTED LEGISLATIVE CHANGES RELATING TO SOCIETY, EDUCATION, TAXATION, AND CRIMINAL LAW. HIS CANONICAL LAW (OR THE KANUNS) FIXED THE FORM OF THE EMPIRE FOR CENTURIES AFTER HIS DEATH. NOT ONLY WAS SULEIMAN A DISTINGUISHED POET AND GOLDSMITH IN HIS OWN RIGHT; HE ALSO BECAME A GREAT PATRON OF CULTURE, OVERSEEING THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE'S ARTISTIC, LITERARY AND ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT.


IN A BREAK WITH OTTOMAN TRADITION, SULEIMAN MARRIED A HAREM GIRL WHO BECAME HURREM SULTAN, WHOSE INTRIGUES IN THE COURT AND POWER OVER THE SULTAN HAVE BECOME AS FAMOUS AS SULEIMAN HIMSELF."
-- REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 

242 "... HIS ASSISTANT WAS A HAREM GIRL WHO ROSE UP FROM SLAVERY TO BECOME HIS WIFE..."
" ACCORDING TO LATE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SOURCES SUCH AS THE POLISH POET SAMUEL TWARDOWSKI, SHE WAS BORN IN THE TOWN WHICH WAS THEN PART OF THE KINGDOM OF POLAND. SHE WAS CAPTURED BY CRIMEAN TATARS DURING ONE OF THEIR FREQUENT RAIDS INTO THIS REGION AND TAKEN AS A SLAVE, PROBABLY FIRST TO THE CRIMEAN CITY OF KAFFA, A MAJOR CENTRE OF THE SLAVE TRADE, THEN TO ISTANBUL, AND WAS SELECTED FOR SULEYMAN'S HAREM.


SULEIMAN WAS INFATUATED WITH HURREM SULTAN, A HAREM GIRL OF RUTHENIAN ORIGIN. IN THE WEST FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, TAKING NOTICE OF THE PALACE GOSSIP ABOUT HER, CALLED HER "RUSSELAZIE" OR "ROXOLANA", REFERRING TO HER SLAVIC ORIGINS. THE DAUGHTER OF AN ORTHODOX UKRAINIAN PRIEST, SHE WAS CAPTURED AND ROSE THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE HAREM TO BECOME SULEIMAN'S FAVORITE.

 

BREAKING WITH TWO CENTURIES OF OTTOMAN TRADITION, A FORMER CONCUBINE HAD THUS BECOME THE LEGAL WIFE OF THE SULTAN, MUCH TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF OBSERVERS IN THE PALACE AND THE CITY. HE ALSO ALLOWED HURREM SULTAN TO REMAIN WITH HIM AT COURT FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE, BREAKING ANOTHER TRADITION—THAT WHEN IMPERIAL HEIRS CAME OF AGE, THEY WOULD BE SENT ALONG WITH THE IMPERIAL CONCUBINE WHO BORE THEM TO GOVERN REMOTE PROVINCES OF THE EMPIRE, NEVER TO RETURN UNLESS THEIR PROGENY SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE.
 

UNDER HIS PEN NAME, MUHIBBI, SULEIMAN COMPOSED THIS POEM FOR ROXOLANA:

"THRONE OF MY LONELY NICHE, MY WEALTH, MY LOVE, MY MOONLIGHT.
MY MOST SINCERE FRIEND, MY CONFIDANT, MY VERY EXISTENCE, MY SULTAN, MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE.
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AMONG THE BEAUTIFUL...
MY SPRINGTIME, MY MERRY FACED LOVE, MY DAYTIME, MY SWEETHEART, LAUGHING LEAF...

MY PLANTS, MY SWEET, MY ROSE, THE ONE ONLY WHO DOES NOT DISTRESS ME IN THIS WORLD... MY ISTANBUL, MY CARAMAN,

THE EARTH OF MY ANATOLIA MY BADAKHSHAN, MY BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN
MY WOMAN OF THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR, MY LOVE OF THE SLANTED BROW, MY LOVE OF EYES FULL OF MISCHIEF.
I'LL SING YOUR PRAISES ALWAYS
I, LOVER OF THE TORMENTED HEART, MUHIBBI OF THE EYES FULL OF TEARS, I AM HAPPY."

ROXELANA, AS SHE IS BETTER KNOWN IN EUROPE, IS WELL-KNOWN BOTH IN MODERN TURKEY AND IN THE WEST, AND IS THE SUBJECT OF MANY ARTISTIC WORKS. SHE HAS INSPIRED PAINTINGS, MUSICAL WORKS (INCLUDING JOSEPH HAYDN'S SYMPHONY NO. 63), AN OPERA BY DENYS SICHYNSKY, A BALLET, PLAYS, AND SEVERAL NOVELS."

243 "... QUEEN ELIZABETH... "
ELIZABETH I (7 SEPTEMBER 1533 - 24 MARCH 1603) WAS QUEEN OF ENGLAND AND QUEEN OF IRELAND FROM 17 NOVEMBER 1558 UNTIL HER DEATH.

 

SOMETIMES CALLED THE VIRGIN QUEEN, GLORIANA, THE FAERIE QUEEN OR GOOD QUEEN BESS, ELIZABETH WAS THE FIFTH AND LAST MONARCH OF THE TUDOR DYNASTY. THE DAUGHTER OF HENRY VIII, SHE WAS BORN A PRINCESS, BUT HER MOTHER, ANNE BOLEYN, WAS EXECUTED THREE YEARS AFTER HER BIRTH, AND ELIZABETH WAS DECLARED ILLEGITIMATE.

 

PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON, HER BROTHER, EDWARD VI, CUT HER OUT OF THE SUCCESSION. HIS WILL, HOWEVER, WAS SET ASIDE, AS IT CONTRAVENED THE THIRD SUCCESSION ACT OF 1543, IN WHICH ELIZABETH WAS NAMED AS SUCCESSOR PROVIDED THAT MARY I OF ENGLAND, ELIZABETH'S HALF-SISTER, SHOULD DIE WITHOUT ISSUE. IN 1558, ELIZABETH SUCCEEDED HER HALF-SISTER, DURING WHOSE REIGN SHE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED FOR NEARLY A YEAR ON SUSPICION OF SUPPORTING PROTESTANT REBELS.


ELIZABETH SET OUT TO RULE BY GOOD COUNSEL. ONE OF HER FIRST MOVES WAS TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENGLISH PROTESTANT CHURCH, OF WHICH SHE BECAME THE SUPREME GOVERNOR. THIS ELIZABETHAN RELIGIOUS SETTLEMENT HELD FIRM THROUGHOUT HER REIGN AND LATER EVOLVED INTO TODAY'S CHURCH OF ENGLAND. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT ELIZABETH WOULD MARRY, BUT DESPITE SEVERAL PETITIONS FROM PARLIAMENT, SHE NEVER DID. THE REASONS FOR THIS CHOICE ARE UNKNOWN, AND THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH DEBATED.

 

AS SHE GREW OLDER, ELIZABETH BECAME FAMOUS FOR HER VIRGINITY, AND A CULT GREW UP AROUND HER WHICH WAS CELEBRATED IN THE PORTRAITS, PAGEANTS AND LITERATURE OF THE DAY.


ONE OF HER MOTTOS WAS VIDEO ET TACEO; "I SEE, AND SAY NOTHING".


THIS STRATEGY, VIEWED WITH IMPATIENCE BY HER COUNSELORS, OFTEN SAVED HER FROM POLITICAL AND MARITAL MISALLIANCES. THOUGH ELIZABETH WAS CAUTIOUS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ONLY HALF-HEARTEDLY SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF INEFFECTIVE, POORLY RESOURCED MILITARY CAMPAIGNS IN THE NETHERLANDS, FRANCE AND IRELAND, THE DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA IN 1588 ASSOCIATED HER NAME FOREVER WITH WHAT IS POPULARLY VIEWED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST VICTORIES IN BRITISH HISTORY.

 

WITHIN TWENTY YEARS OF HER DEATH, SHE WAS BEING CELEBRATED AS THE RULER OF A GOLDEN AGE, AN IMAGE THAT RETAINS ITS HOLD ON THE ENGLISH PEOPLE.

 

ELIZABETH'S REIGN IS KNOWN AS THE ELIZABETHAN ERA, FAMOUS ABOVE ALL FOR THE FLOURISHING OF ENGLISH DRAMA, LED BY PLAYWRIGHTS SUCH AS WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE."

244 "... HE WAS INCARNATED AS CECIL RHODES."
CECIL JOHN RHODES, (JULY 5, 1853 - MARCH 26, 1902) WAS A BRITISH-BORN SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESSMAN, MINING MAGNATE, AND POLITICIAN. HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE DIAMOND COMPANY DE BEERS, WHICH TODAY MARKETS 60% OF THE WORLD'S ROUGH DIAMONDS AND AT ONE TIME MARKETED 90%. HE WAS AN ARDENT BELIEVER IN COLONIALISM AND WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE STATE OF RHODESIA, WHICH WAS NAMED AFTER HIM.


RHODES PROFITED GREATLY FROM CONTROLLING SOUTHERN AFRICA'S NATURAL RESOURCES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH FUNDED THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP UPON HIS DEATH. RHODES NEVER MARRIED, PLEADING THAT "I HAVE TOO MUCH WORK ON MY HANDS" AND SAYING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE A DUTIFUL HUSBAND. QUEEN VICTORIA REPORTEDLY ASKED HIM IF HE WAS A WOMAN-HATER, WHICH RHODES DENIED INSISTING "HOW COULD I DISLIKE A SEX TO WHICH YOUR MAJESTY BELONGS?"
 

RHODES FAMOUSLY DECLARED:

"TO THINK OF THESE STARS THAT YOU SEE OVERHEAD AT NIGHT, THESE VAST WORLDS WHICH WE CAN NEVER REACH. I WOULD ANNEX THE PLANETS IF I COULD; I OFTEN THINK OF THAT. IT MAKES ME SAD TO SEE THEM SO CLEAR AND YET SO FAR."

245 "... SHE WAS A POLISH PRINCESS... "
"PRINCESS CATHERINE RADZIWILL (MARCH 30, 1858 - MAY 12, 1941) WAS A POLISH PRINCESS FROM A FAMOUS POLISH-LITHUANIAN ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY CALLED THE RADZIWILLS. SHE WAS BORN AS COUNTESS EKATERINA ADAMOVNA RZEWUSKA. SHE MARRIED PRINCE WILHELM RADZIWILL AT AGE 15 AND MOVED TO BERLIN TO LIVE WITH HIS FAMILY. IT WAS SPECULATED THAT SHE WAS THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK GOSSIPING ABOUT THE GERMAN EMPEROR WILLIAM II AND BERLIN SOCIETY IN 1884 UNDER THE PEN NAME PAUL VASILI.


SHE STALKED THE ENGLISH-BORN SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICIAN CECIL RHODES AND ASKED HIM TO MARRY HER, BUT HE REFUSED. SHE WROTE A BIOGRAPHY OF RHODES CALLED "CECIL RHODES: MAN AND EMPIRE MAKER".

246 "... ONE WAS NAMED KELLY... "
WILLIAM KELLY (AUGUST 22, 1811 - FEBRUARY 11, 1888), BORN IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, WAS AN AMERICAN INVENTOR. KELLY STUDIED METALLURGY AT THE WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. KELLY STARTED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS "AIR-BOILING PROCESS," A PROCESS OF BLOWING AIR UP THROUGH MOLTEN IRON TO REDUCE THE CARBON CONTENT, IN 1847.

 

HIS INITIAL GOAL WAS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUEL REQUIRED FOR IRON AND STEEL MAKING, BECAUSE OF THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TIMBER REQUIRED TO MAKE THE CHARCOAL. HE DISCOVERED THAT, CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS IRON WORKERS, THE INJECTED AIR DID NOT COOL THE MOLTEN IRON, BUT INSTEAD COMBINED WITH THE CARBON TO CAUSE THE IRON TO BOIL AND BURN VIOLENTLY UNTIL THE CARBON WAS GREATLY REDUCED, IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE IRON OR CONVERTING IT TO STEEL. HIS EXPERIMENTS BEGAN IN 1847.

 

THE SAME PROCESS WAS LATER INDEPENDENTLY INVENTED AND PATENTED BY HENRY BESSEMER."
-- REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 

247 "...THE OTHER WAS BESSEMER..."
"SIR HENRY BESSEMER (JANUARY 19, 1813 - MARCH 15, 1898), ENGLISH ENGINEER AND INVENTOR. BESSEMER'S NAME IS CHIEFLY KNOWN IN CONNECTION WITH THE BESSEMER PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF STEEL. PATENTS OF SUCH OBVIOUS VALUE DID NOT ESCAPE CRITICISM, AND INVALIDITY WAS FREELY URGED AGAINST THEM ON VARIOUS GROUNDS. BUT BESSEMER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THEM INTACT WITHOUT LITIGATION, THOUGH HE FOUND IT ADVISABLE TO BUY UP THE RIGHTS OF ONE PATENTEE, WHILE IN ANOTHER CASE HE WAS FREED FROM ANXIETY BY THE PATENT BEING ALLOWED TO LAPSE IN 1859 THROUGH NON-PAYMENT OF FEES."
-- REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 

248 " ANOTHER IS-BE WHO DID THIS WAS ALEXANDER BELL..."
"AS IS SOMETIMES COMMON IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES, SIMULTANEOUS DEVELOPMENTS CAN OCCUR, AS EVIDENCED BY A NUMBER OF INVENTORS WHO WERE AT WORK ON THE TELEPHONE.


ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL (3 MARCH 1847 - 2 AUGUST 1922) WAS AN EMINENT SCIENTIST, INVENTOR AND INNOVATOR WHO IS CREDITED WITH THE INVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE. HIS FATHER, GRANDFATHER AND BROTHER HAD ALL BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WORK ON ELOCUTION AND SPEECH, AND BOTH HIS MOTHER AND WIFE WERE DEAF, PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCING BELL'S LIFE'S WORK. HIS RESEARCH ON HEARING AND SPEECH FURTHER LED HIM TO EXPERIMENT WITH HEARING DEVICES THAT EVENTUALLY CULMINATED IN BELL BEING AWARDED THE FIRST U.S. PATENT FOR THE INVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE IN 1876.


IN REFLECTION, BELL CONSIDERED HIS MOST FAMOUS INVENTION AN INTRUSION ON HIS REAL WORK AS A SCIENTIST AND REFUSED TO HAVE A TELEPHONE IN HIS STUDY."
-- REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 

249 ..." IT WAS INVENTED BY SEVERAL OTHERS, INCLUDING ELISHA GRAY."
"ELISHA GRAY (AUGUST 2, 1835 - JANUARY 21, 1901) WAS AN AMERICAN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND IS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS DEVELOPMENT OF A TELEPHONE PROTOTYPE IN 1876 IN HIGHLAND PARK, ILLINOIS, U.S.A.. MR. ELISHA GRAY, OF CHICAGO ALSO DEVISED A TONE TELEGRAPH OF THIS KIND ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS HERR LA COUR. IN THIS APPARATUS A VIBRATING STEEL REED INTERRUPTED THE CURRENT, WHICH AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE PASSED THROUGH AN ELECTROMAGNET AND VIBRATED A MATCHING STEEL REED NEAR ITS POLES. GRAY'S 'HARMONIC TELEGRAPH,' WITH THE VIBRATING REEDS, WAS USED BY THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.

 

SINCE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VIBRATIONS — THAT IS TO SAY, MORE THAN ONE NOTE — CAN BE SENT OVER THE SAME WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE HARMONIC TELEGRAPH CAN BE UTILIZED AS A 'MULTIPLEX' OR MANY-PLY TELEGRAPH, CONVEYING SEVERAL MESSAGES THROUGH THE SAME WIRE AT ONCE; AND THESE CAN EITHER BE READ BY THE OPERATOR BY THE SOUND, OR A PERMANENT RECORD CAN BE MADE BY THE MARKS DRAWN ON A RIBBON OF TRAVELLING PAPER BY A MORSE RECORDER. BELL'S MARCH 10, 1876 LABORATORY NOTEBOOK ENTRY DESCRIBING HIS FIRST SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT WITH THE TELEPHONE.


BELL'S PATENT APPLICATION FOR THE TELEPHONE WAS FILED IN THE US PATENT OFFICE ON FEBRUARY 14, 1876. THE USUAL STORY SAYS THAT BELL GOT TO THE PATENT OFFICE AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE HIS RIVAL ELISHA GRAY, AND THAT GRAY LOST HIS RIGHTS TO THE TELEPHONE AS A RESULT.


ACCORDING TO GRAY'S ACCOUNT, HIS PATENT CAVEAT WAS TAKEN TO THE US PATENT OFFICE A FEW HOURS BEFORE BELL'S APPLICATION, SHORTLY AFTER THE PATENT OFFICE OPENED AND REMAINED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE IN-BASKET UNTIL THAT AFTERNOON. BELL'S APPLICATION WAS FILED SHORTLY BEFORE NOON ON 14 FEBRUARY BY BELL'S LAWYER WHO REQUESTED THAT THE FILING FEE BE ENTERED IMMEDIATELY ONTO THE CASH RECEIPTS BLOTTER AND THAT BELL'S APPLICATION BE TAKEN TO THE EXAMINER IMMEDIATELY.

 

LATE THAT AFTERNOON, THE FEE FOR GRAY'S CAVEAT WAS ENTERED ON THE CASH BLOTTER AND THE CAVEAT WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE EXAMINER UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE FACT THAT BELL'S FILING FEE WAS RECORDED EARLIER THAN GRAY'S FEE LED TO THE STORY THAT BELL HAD ARRIVED AT THE PATENT OFFICE EARLIER. BELL WAS IN BOSTON ON FEBRUARY 14 AND DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS HAPPENING UNTIL HE ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON ON FEBRUARY 26.

 

WHETHER BELL'S APPLICATION WAS FILED BEFORE OR AFTER GRAY'S CAVEAT NO LONGER MATTERED, BECAUSE GRAY ABANDONED HIS CAVEAT, WHICH OPENED THE DOOR TO BELL BEING GRANTED U.S. PATENT 174,465_ FOR THE TELEPHONE ON 7 MARCH 1876."

POST SCRIPT FROM MRS. MACELROY

 

EDITOR' NOTE:

THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE WAS ENCLOSED IN A SEPARATE ENVELOPE MARKED "READ ME LAST", TOGETHER WITH THE ORIGINAL LETTER, THE TRANSCRIPTS AND THE OTHER NOTES OF EXPLANATION I RECEIVED IN THE ENVELOPE FROM MRS. MACELROY.

 

THIS IS WHAT THE MESSAGE SAID:


"THE OTHER DOCUMENTS IN THIS ENVELOPE ARE THE END OF THE STORY, AS FAR AS WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN 1947. HOWEVER, SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT GOT ME SETTLED AT MY FINAL RELOCATION DESTINATION, I CONTINUED MY COMMUNICATION WITH AIRL ON A REGULAR BASIS.


IT HAS BEEN ALMOST EXACTLY 40 YEARS SINCE THE CRASH AT ROSWELL. SINCE THEN IT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY WITH AIRL FOR ONE REASON: I AM ONE OF THE 3,000 MEMBERS OF THE LOST BATTALION. AT THIS TIME, ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE LOST BATTALION HAVE BEEN LOCATED ON EARTH AS A RESULT OF THE DOMAIN ANUNNAKI MISSION AND THEIR USE OF THE "TREE OF LIFE" DETECTION DEVICE.


THROUGH MY COMMUNICATION WITH AIRL, I HAVE RECOVERED SOME OF MY MEMORY OF LIVES I'VE SPENT ON EARTH OVER THE PAST 8,000 YEARS. MOST OF THESE MEMORIES ARE NOT ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT COMPARED TO THE LONG BACKTRACK OF EVENTS, BUT IT HAS BEEN A NECESSARY STEPPING STONE TO REGAINING MY AWARENESS AND ABILITY AS AN IS-BE.


I CAN ALSO REMEMBER SOME DIM PATCHES OF MY LIFE IN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE. I WAS A NURSE THERE TOO. FOR THE MOST PART I'VE BEEN A NURSE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN DOWN THROUGH THE AGES. I STICK WITH BEING A NURSE BECAUSE IT IS FAMILIAR TO ME. AND, I ENJOY THE WORK OF HELPING PEOPLE, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE RACE OF BIOLOGICAL BEINGS IN THE DOMAIN WHOSE BODIES LOOK MORE LIKE INSECTS THAN MAMMALS, ESPECIALLY THEIR HANDS. EVEN DOLL BODIES NEED SOME REPAIR ONCE IN AWHILE, TOO.


AS I REMEMBER MORE ABOUT MY PAST, I REALIZE THAT THE REST OF MY LIFE IS IN THE FUTURE. ETERNITY IS NOT JUST IN THE PAST. ETERNITY IS IN THE FUTURE. AT
THIS POINT I AM STILL NOT ABLE TO FULLY RETURN TO THE DOMAIN. I AM SENTENCED TO ETERNAL IMPRISONMENT, LIKE ALL OTHER IS-BES IN THE LIVING HELL CALLED EARTH, UNTIL WE CAN DISABLE THE "OLD EMPIRE" FORCE SCREENS.


BECAUSE I WON'T KEEP MY BIOLOGICAL BODY MUCH LONGER NOW, I AM INTENSELY AWARE THAT VERY SOON I WILL BE RECYCLED THROUGH THE AMNESIA PROCESS OF THE "OLD EMPIRE", AND STUCK BACK INTO ANOTHER BABY BODY TO START ALL OVER AGAIN - WITHOUT ANY MEMORY OF WHAT WENT BEFORE.


AS YOU KNOW, MEMBERS OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. AIRL SAYS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE DOMAIN HAS LOCATED ALL OF THE LOST BATTALION OFFICERS AND CREW, THE SUCCESS OF FREEING THEM DEPENDS ON THE IS-BES WHO ARE ALREADY ON EARTH. THE DOMAIN CENTRAL COMMAND CANNOT AUTHORIZE ANY PERSONNEL OR RESOURCES, AT THIS TIME, TO CONDUCT A "RESCUE MISSION" AS THIS IN NOT THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE IN THIS GALAXY.


SO, IF IS-BES ON EARTH ARE GOING TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PRISON, IT WILL HAVE TO BE AN "INSIDE JOB", SO TO SPEAK. THE INMATES WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEMSELVES OUT. VARIOUS METHODS OF RECOVERING THE MEMORY AND ABILITY OF IS-BES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST 10,000 YEARS ON EARTH, BUT NONE HAVE PROVEN TO BE CONSISTENTLY EFFECTIVE SO FAR.


AIRL MENTIONED THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH WAS MADE BY GAUTAMA SIDDHARTHA ABOUT 2,500 YEARS AGO. HOWEVER, THE ORIGINAL TEACHINGS AND TECHNIQUES TAUGHT BY THE BUDDHA HAVE BEEN ALTERED OR LOST OVER THE MILLENNIA SINCE THEN. THE PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES OF HIS PHILOSOPHY WERE PERVERTED INTO ROBOTIC RELIGIOUS RITUALS BY PRIESTS AS A SELF-SERVING INSTRUMENT OF CONTROL OR SLAVERY.


HOWEVER, ANOTHER MAJOR ADVANCE OCCURRED RECENTLY. AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE SPACE STATION IS AN IS-BE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN AN IMPORTANT ENGINEER AND OFFICER IN THE "OLD EMPIRE" SPACE FLEET. HE BECOME AN "UNTOUCHABLE" HIMSELF ABOUT 10,000 YEARS AGO AND WAS SENTENCED TO EARTH FOR LEADING A MUTINY AGAINST THE OPPRESSIVE REGIME OF THE "OLD EMPIRE". THE ENGINEER WAS TRAINED IN ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC IMPROVISATION THEORY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. THIS MAN HAS APPLIED HIS EXPERTISE TO HELPING THE DOMAIN SOLVE THE APPARENTLY UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM OF RESCUING THE MEMBERS OF THE LOST BATTALION, AS WELL AS THE IS-BES ON EARTH.


CAREFUL OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE MECHANICS OF MEMORY IN IS-BES BY HE AND HIS WIFE, WHO ASSISTED HIM, LED TO THE REALIZATION THAT IS-BES CAN RECOVER FROM AMNESIA AND ALSO REGAIN LOST ABILITIES. TOGETHER THEY DISCOVERED AND DEVELOPED EFFECTIVE METHODS THAT THEY USED TO REHABILITATE THEIR OWN MEMORIES. THEY EVENTUALLY CODIFIED THEIR METHODS SO THAT OTHERS CAN SAFELY BE TRAINED TO APPLY THEM TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS, WITHOUT DETECTION BY THE "OLD EMPIRE" THOUGHT CONTROL OPERATORS.


THEIR RESEARCH ALSO REVEALED THAT IS-BES CAN OCCUPY AND OPERATE MORE THAN ONE BODY AT THE SAME TIME -A FACT THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS THOUGHT TO BE UNIQUELY LIMITED TO OFFICERS OF THE DOMAIN.


ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS FACT IS THAT THE ENGINEER, IN A PREVIOUS LIFETIME ON EARTH, WAS SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT 241 (FOOTNOTE). HIS ASSISTANT WAS A HAREM GIRL WHO ROSE UP FROM SLAVERY TO BECOME HIS WIFE AND RULE THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE WITH HIM. 242 (FOOTNOTE) SIMULTANEOUSLY, SHE INHABITED ANOTHER BODY AND RULED HER OWN EMPIRE AS QUEEN ELIZABETH. 243 (FOOTNOTE) AS THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND, SHE NEVER MARRIED, BECAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY MARRIED TO THE SULTAN OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE!


IN A LATER LIFE HE WAS INCARNATED AS CECIL RHODES. 244 (FOOTNOTE). DURING HIS LIFE AS RHODES SHE WAS, AGAIN, A PRINCESS, THIS TIME FROM POLAND. 245 (FOOTNOTE) AS SUCH, SHE PURSUED RHODES UNSUCCESSFULLY TOWARD THE END OF HIS LIFE. HOWEVER, IN THEIR NEXT INCARNATION THEY MET AGAIN, WERE MARRIED, HAD A FAMILY, AND AGAIN, WORKED TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY ALL OF THEIR LIVES.


SEVERAL OTHER NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF THIS PHENOMENA WERE OBSERVED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROCESS OF REFINING STEEL WAS INVENTED BY THE SAME IS-BE WHO INHABITED TWO BODIES SIMULTANEOUSLY. ONE WAS NAMED KELLY 246 (FOOTNOTE) WHO LIVED IN KENTUCKY, AND THE OTHER WAS A MAN NAMED BESSEMER (FOOTNOTE) WHO LIVED IN ENGLAND. THEY BOTH CONCEIVED THE SAME PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME.


ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL 248 (FOOTNOTE) THE INVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE, WHICH WAS INVENTED BY SEVERAL OTHERS AT THE SAME TIME, INCLUDING ELISHA GRAY. 249 (FOOTNOTE) THE TELEPHONE WAS CONCEIVED CONCURRENTLY IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ALL AT ONCE. THIS WAS A SINGLE IS-BE OF SUCH TREMENDOUS ENERGY AND ABILITY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OPERATE SEVERAL BODIES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHILE CONDUCTING COMPLEX RESEARCH WORK!


THANKS TO THESE REVELATIONS, THE DOMAIN HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETURN SOME OF IS-BES OF THE LOST BATTALION TO ACTIVE DUTY ON A LIMITED, PART-TIME BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO YOUNG GIRLS WHO OCCUPY BIOLOGICAL BODIES ON EARTH ARE NOW, AT THE SAME TIME, WORKING AS ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE ON THE ASTEROID SPACE STATION AS OPERATORS OF A COMMUNICATION SWITCHBOARD. THESE OPERATORS RELAY MESSAGES BETWEEN THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THE DOMAIN COMMAND HEADQUARTERS.


RECENTLY, I, MYSELF HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RESUME SOME OF MY OWN DUTIES FOR THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WHILE CONTINUING TO LIVE ON EARTH. THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK HOWEVER, AND CAN ONLY BE DONE WHILE MY BIOLOGICAL BODY IS SLEEPING.


IT MAKES ME VERY, VERY HAPPY TO KNOW THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE TO STAY ON EARTH FOREVER! THERE IS HOPE OF ESCAPE, NOT JUST FOR THE LOST BATTALION, BUT FOR MANY OTHER IS-BES ON EARTH.


HOWEVER, ALL IS-BES COULD BE HELPED TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE ACTUAL SITUATION ON EARTH THROUGH THE INFORMATION IN THIS ENVELOPE. THIS IS WHY I SENT THESE LETTERS AND TRANSCRIPTS TO YOU. I WANT YOU TO GET THESE DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED. I WANT IS-BES ON EARTH TO HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING ON EARTH.


MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE ANY OF IT, I'M SURE. IT SEEMS TOO INCREDIBLE. NO "REASONABLE" PERSON WOULD EVER BELIEVE A WORD OF IT. HOWEVER, IT ONLY SEEMS "INCREDIBLE" TO AN IS-BE WHOSE MEMORY HAS BEEN ERASED AND REPLACED WITH FALSE INFORMATION INSIDE THE ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED ILLUSION OF A PRISON PLANET. WE MUST NOT ALLOW THE APPARENT INCREDIBILITY OF OUR SITUATION TO PREVENT US FROM CONFRONTING THE REALITY OF IT.


FRANKLY, "REASONS" HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. THERE ARE NO REASONS. THINGS ARE WHAT THEY ARE. IF WE DON'T FACE THE FACTS OF OUR SITUATION, WE'RE GOING TO STAY UNDER THE THUMB OF THE "OLD EMPIRE" FOREVER! THE BIGGEST WEAPON THE "OLD EMPIRE" HAS LEFT NOW IS OUR IGNORANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO ALL THE IS-BES ON EARTH. DISBELIEF AND SECRECY ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS THEY HAVE!


THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT CLASSIFIED THE ENCLOSED TRANSCRIPTS AS "TOP SECRET" ARE RUN BY IS-BES WHO ARE NOTHING MORE THAN MINDLESS AUTOMATONS COVERTLY ORDERED ABOUT THROUGH HYPNOTIC COMMANDS GIVEN BY THE "OLD EMPIRE" PRISON OPERATORS. THEY ARE THE UNKNOWING SLAVES OF UNSEEN SLAVE MASTERS - AND ALL THE MORE ENSLAVED BY THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BE SLAVES.


MOST OF THE IS-BES ON EARTH ARE GOOD, HONEST, ABLE BEINGS: ARTISTS, MANAGERS, GENIUSES, FREE THINKERS AND REVOLUTIONARIES WHO HAVE HARMED NO ONE, REALLY. THEY ARE NO THREAT TO ANYONE EXCEPT THE CRIMINALS WHO HAVE IMPRISONED THEM.


THEY MUST FIND OUT ABOUT THE "OLD EMPIRE" AMNESIA AND HYPNOSIS OPERATION. THEY MUST REMEMBER THEIR OWN PAST LIVES. THE ONLY WAY THIS WILL EVER HAPPEN IS TO COMMUNICATE, COORDINATE AND FIGHT BACK. WE HAVE TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE TO DISCUSS IT OPENLY WITH EACH OTHER. COMMUNICATION IS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST SECRECY AND OPPRESSION.


THIS IS WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO TELL THIS STORY. PLEASE SHARE THESE TRANSCRIPTS WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN. IF THE PEOPLE OF EARTH ARE TOLD WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE, PERHAPS THEY WILL BEGIN TO REMEMBER WHO THEY ARE, AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM.


FOR NOW, WE CAN BEGIN OUR OWN RELEASE AND RESCUE WITH WORDS. WE CAN BE FREE AGAIN. WE CAN BE OURSELVES AGAIN.

 

PERHAPS I WILL MEET YOU IN PERSON, WITH OR WITHOUT A BODY, SOMEWHERE IN OUR ETERNAL FUTURE.

GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US,

MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY

"SULEIMAN I (OTTOMAN TURKISH: SULAYMAN, TURKISH: SULEYMAN; ALMOST ALWAYS KANUNI SULTAN SULEYMAN IN TURKISH) (NOVEMBER 6, 1494 - SEPTEMBER 5/6, 1566), WAS THE TENTH AND LONGEST-REIGNING SULTAN OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, FROM 1520 TO HIS DEATH IN 1566. HE IS KNOWN IN THE WEST AS SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT AND IN THE EAST, AS THE LAWGIVER (IN TURKISH KANUNI; ARABIC: , AL - QANUNT), FOR HIS COMPLETE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE OTTOMAN LEGAL SYSTEM. SULEIMAN BECAME THE PRE-EMINENT MONARCH OF 16TH CENTURY EUROPE, PRESIDING OVER THE APEX OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE'S MILITARY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER.

 

SULEIMAN PERSONALLY LED OTTOMAN ARMIES TO CONQUER THE CHRISTIAN STRONGHOLDS OF BELGRADE, RHODES, AND MOST OF HUNGARY BEFORE HIS CONQUESTS WERE CHECKED AT THE SIEGE OF VIENNA IN 1529. HE ANNEXED MOST OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN HIS CONFLICT WITH THE PERSIANS AND LARGE SWATHES OF NORTH AFRICA AS FAR WEST AS ALGERIA. UNDER HIS RULE, THE OTTOMAN FLEET DOMINATED THE SEAS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN TO THE INDIAN OCEAN.
 

AT THE HELM OF AN EXPANDING EMPIRE, SULEIMAN PERSONALLY INSTITUTED LEGISLATIVE CHANGES RELATING TO SOCIETY, EDUCATION, TAXATION, AND CRIMINAL LAW. HIS CANONICAL LAW (OR THE KANUNS) FIXED THE FORM OF THE EMPIRE FOR CENTURIES AFTER HIS DEATH. NOT ONLY WAS SULEIMAN A DISTINGUISHED POET AND GOLDSMITH IN HIS OWN RIGHT; HE ALSO BECAME A GREAT PATRON OF CULTURE, OVERSEEING THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE'S ARTISTIC, LITERARY AND ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT.


IN A BREAK WITH OTTOMAN TRADITION, SULEIMAN MARRIED A HAREM GIRL WHO BECAME HURREM SULTAN, WHOSE INTRIGUES IN THE COURT AND POWER OVER THE SULTAN HAVE BECOME AS FAMOUS AS SULEIMAN HIMSELF."

242 "... HIS ASSISTANT WAS A HAREM GIRL WHO ROSE UP FROM SLAVERY TO BECOME HIS WIFE..."
" ACCORDING TO LATE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SOURCES SUCH AS THE POLISH POET SAMUEL TWARDOWSKI, SHE WAS BORN IN THE TOWN WHICH WAS THEN PART OF THE KINGDOM OF POLAND. SHE WAS CAPTURED BY CRIMEAN TATARS DURING ONE OF THEIR FREQUENT RAIDS INTO THIS REGION AND TAKEN AS A SLAVE, PROBABLY FIRST TO THE CRIMEAN CITY OF KAFFA, A MAJOR CENTRE OF THE SLAVE TRADE, THEN TO ISTANBUL, AND WAS SELECTED FOR SULEYMAN'S HAREM.


SULEIMAN WAS INFATUATED WITH HURREM SULTAN, A HAREM GIRL OF RUTHENIAN ORIGIN. IN THE WEST FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, TAKING NOTICE OF THE PALACE GOSSIP ABOUT HER, CALLED HER "RUSSELAZIE" OR "ROXOLANA", REFERRING TO HER SLAVIC ORIGINS. THE DAUGHTER OF AN ORTHODOX UKRAINIAN PRIEST, SHE WAS CAPTURED AND ROSE THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE HAREM TO BECOME SULEIMAN'S FAVORITE.

 

BREAKING WITH TWO CENTURIES OF OTTOMAN TRADITION, A FORMER CONCUBINE HAD THUS BECOME THE LEGAL WIFE OF THE SULTAN, MUCH TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF OBSERVERS IN THE PALACE AND THE CITY. HE ALSO ALLOWED HURREM SULTAN TO REMAIN WITH HIM AT COURT FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE, BREAKING ANOTHER TRADITION—THAT WHEN IMPERIAL HEIRS CAME OF AGE, THEY WOULD BE SENT ALONG WITH THE IMPERIAL CONCUBINE WHO BORE THEM TO GOVERN REMOTE PROVINCES OF THE EMPIRE, NEVER TO RETURN UNLESS THEIR PROGENY SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE.
 

UNDER HIS PEN NAME, MUHIBBI, SULEIMAN COMPOSED THIS POEM FOR ROXOLANA:

"THRONE OF MY LONELY NICHE, MY WEALTH, MY LOVE, MY MOONLIGHT.
MY MOST SINCERE FRIEND, MY CONFIDANT, MY VERY EXISTENCE, MY SULTAN, MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE.
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AMONG THE BEAUTIFUL...
MY SPRINGTIME, MY MERRY FACED LOVE, MY DAYTIME, MY SWEETHEART, LAUGHING LEAF...

MY PLANTS, MY SWEET, MY ROSE, THE ONE ONLY WHO DOES NOT DISTRESS ME IN THIS WORLD... MY ISTANBUL, MY CARAMAN,

THE EARTH OF MY ANATOLIA MY BADAKHSHAN, MY BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN
MY WOMAN OF THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR, MY LOVE OF THE SLANTED BROW, MY LOVE OF EYES FULL OF MISCHIEF.
I'LL SING YOUR PRAISES ALWAYS
I, LOVER OF THE TORMENTED HEART, MUHIBBI OF THE EYES FULL OF TEARS, I AM HAPPY."

ROXELANA, AS SHE IS BETTER KNOWN IN EUROPE, IS WELL-KNOWN BOTH IN MODERN TURKEY AND IN THE WEST, AND IS THE SUBJECT OF MANY ARTISTIC WORKS. SHE HAS INSPIRED PAINTINGS, MUSICAL WORKS (INCLUDING JOSEPH HAYDN'S SYMPHONY NO. 63), AN OPERA BY DENYS SICHYNSKY, A BALLET, PLAYS, AND SEVERAL NOVELS."

243 "... QUEEN ELIZABETH... "
ELIZABETH I (7 SEPTEMBER 1533 - 24 MARCH 1603) WAS QUEEN OF ENGLAND AND QUEEN OF IRELAND FROM 17 NOVEMBER 1558 UNTIL HER DEATH.

 

SOMETIMES CALLED THE VIRGIN QUEEN, GLORIANA, THE FAERIE QUEEN OR GOOD QUEEN BESS, ELIZABETH WAS THE FIFTH AND LAST MONARCH OF THE TUDOR DYNASTY. THE DAUGHTER OF HENRY VIII, SHE WAS BORN A PRINCESS, BUT HER MOTHER, ANNE BOLEYN, WAS EXECUTED THREE YEARS AFTER HER BIRTH, AND ELIZABETH WAS DECLARED ILLEGITIMATE.

 

PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON, HER BROTHER, EDWARD VI, CUT HER OUT OF THE SUCCESSION. HIS WILL, HOWEVER, WAS SET ASIDE, AS IT CONTRAVENED THE THIRD SUCCESSION ACT OF 1543, IN WHICH ELIZABETH WAS NAMED AS SUCCESSOR PROVIDED THAT MARY I OF ENGLAND, ELIZABETH'S HALF-SISTER, SHOULD DIE WITHOUT ISSUE. IN 1558, ELIZABETH SUCCEEDED HER HALF-SISTER, DURING WHOSE REIGN SHE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED FOR NEARLY A YEAR ON SUSPICION OF SUPPORTING PROTESTANT REBELS.


ELIZABETH SET OUT TO RULE BY GOOD COUNSEL. ONE OF HER FIRST MOVES WAS TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENGLISH PROTESTANT CHURCH, OF WHICH SHE BECAME THE SUPREME GOVERNOR. THIS ELIZABETHAN RELIGIOUS SETTLEMENT HELD FIRM THROUGHOUT HER REIGN AND LATER EVOLVED INTO TODAY'S CHURCH OF ENGLAND. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT ELIZABETH WOULD MARRY, BUT DESPITE SEVERAL PETITIONS FROM PARLIAMENT, SHE NEVER DID. THE REASONS FOR THIS CHOICE ARE UNKNOWN, AND THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH DEBATED.

 

AS SHE GREW OLDER, ELIZABETH BECAME FAMOUS FOR HER VIRGINITY, AND A CULT GREW UP AROUND HER WHICH WAS CELEBRATED IN THE PORTRAITS, PAGEANTS AND LITERATURE OF THE DAY.


ONE OF HER MOTTOS WAS VIDEO ET TACEO; "I SEE, AND SAY NOTHING".


THIS STRATEGY, VIEWED WITH IMPATIENCE BY HER COUNSELORS, OFTEN SAVED HER FROM POLITICAL AND MARITAL MISALLIANCES. THOUGH ELIZABETH WAS CAUTIOUS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ONLY HALF-HEARTEDLY SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF INEFFECTIVE, POORLY RESOURCED MILITARY CAMPAIGNS IN THE NETHERLANDS, FRANCE AND IRELAND, THE DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH ARMADA IN 1588 ASSOCIATED HER NAME FOREVER WITH WHAT IS POPULARLY VIEWED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST VICTORIES IN BRITISH HISTORY.

 

WITHIN TWENTY YEARS OF HER DEATH, SHE WAS BEING CELEBRATED AS THE RULER OF A GOLDEN AGE, AN IMAGE THAT RETAINS ITS HOLD ON THE ENGLISH PEOPLE.

 

ELIZABETH'S REIGN IS KNOWN AS THE ELIZABETHAN ERA, FAMOUS ABOVE ALL FOR THE FLOURISHING OF ENGLISH DRAMA, LED BY PLAYWRIGHTS SUCH AS WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE AND CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE."

244 "... HE WAS INCARNATED AS CECIL RHODES."
CECIL JOHN RHODES, (JULY 5, 1853 - MARCH 26, 1902) WAS A BRITISH-BORN SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESSMAN, MINING MAGNATE, AND POLITICIAN. HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE DIAMOND COMPANY DE BEERS, WHICH TODAY MARKETS 60% OF THE WORLD'S ROUGH DIAMONDS AND AT ONE TIME MARKETED 90%. HE WAS AN ARDENT BELIEVER IN COLONIALISM AND WAS THE FOUNDER OF THE STATE OF RHODESIA, WHICH WAS NAMED AFTER HIM.


RHODES PROFITED GREATLY FROM CONTROLLING SOUTHERN AFRICA'S NATURAL RESOURCES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH FUNDED THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP UPON HIS DEATH. RHODES NEVER MARRIED, PLEADING THAT "I HAVE TOO MUCH WORK ON MY HANDS" AND SAYING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE A DUTIFUL HUSBAND. QUEEN VICTORIA REPORTEDLY ASKED HIM IF HE WAS A WOMAN-HATER, WHICH RHODES DENIED INSISTING "HOW COULD I DISLIKE A SEX TO WHICH YOUR MAJESTY BELONGS?"
 

RHODES FAMOUSLY DECLARED:

"TO THINK OF THESE STARS THAT YOU SEE OVERHEAD AT NIGHT, THESE VAST WORLDS WHICH WE CAN NEVER REACH. I WOULD ANNEX THE PLANETS IF I COULD; I OFTEN THINK OF THAT. IT MAKES ME SAD TO SEE THEM SO CLEAR AND YET SO FAR."

245 "... SHE WAS A POLISH PRINCESS... "
"PRINCESS CATHERINE RADZIWILL (MARCH 30, 1858 - MAY 12, 1941) WAS A POLISH PRINCESS FROM A FAMOUS POLISH-LITHUANIAN ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY CALLED THE RADZIWILLS. SHE WAS BORN AS COUNTESS EKATERINA ADAMOVNA RZEWUSKA. SHE MARRIED PRINCE WILHELM RADZIWILL AT AGE 15 AND MOVED TO BERLIN TO LIVE WITH HIS FAMILY. IT WAS SPECULATED THAT SHE WAS THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK GOSSIPING ABOUT THE GERMAN EMPEROR WILLIAM II AND BERLIN SOCIETY IN 1884 UNDER THE PEN NAME PAUL VASILI.


SHE STALKED THE ENGLISH-BORN SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICIAN CECIL RHODES AND ASKED HIM TO MARRY HER, BUT HE REFUSED. SHE WROTE A BIOGRAPHY OF RHODES CALLED "CECIL RHODES: MAN AND EMPIRE MAKER".

246 "... ONE WAS NAMED KELLY... "
WILLIAM KELLY (AUGUST 22, 1811 - FEBRUARY 11, 1888), BORN IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, WAS AN AMERICAN INVENTOR. KELLY STUDIED METALLURGY AT THE WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. KELLY STARTED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS "AIR-BOILING PROCESS," A PROCESS OF BLOWING AIR UP THROUGH MOLTEN IRON TO REDUCE THE CARBON CONTENT, IN 1847.

 

HIS INITIAL GOAL WAS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUEL REQUIRED FOR IRON AND STEEL MAKING, BECAUSE OF THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TIMBER REQUIRED TO MAKE THE CHARCOAL. HE DISCOVERED THAT, CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS IRON WORKERS, THE INJECTED AIR DID NOT COOL THE MOLTEN IRON, BUT INSTEAD COMBINED WITH THE CARBON TO CAUSE THE IRON TO BOIL AND BURN VIOLENTLY UNTIL THE CARBON WAS GREATLY REDUCED, IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE IRON OR CONVERTING IT TO STEEL. HIS EXPERIMENTS BEGAN IN 1847.

 

THE SAME PROCESS WAS LATER INDEPENDENTLY INVENTED AND PATENTED BY HENRY BESSEMER."
-- REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 

247 "...THE OTHER WAS BESSEMER..."
"SIR HENRY BESSEMER (JANUARY 19, 1813 - MARCH 15, 1898), ENGLISH ENGINEER AND INVENTOR. BESSEMER'S NAME IS CHIEFLY KNOWN IN CONNECTION WITH THE BESSEMER PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF STEEL. PATENTS OF SUCH OBVIOUS VALUE DID NOT ESCAPE CRITICISM, AND INVALIDITY WAS FREELY URGED AGAINST THEM ON VARIOUS GROUNDS. BUT BESSEMER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THEM INTACT WITHOUT LITIGATION, THOUGH HE FOUND IT ADVISABLE TO BUY UP THE RIGHTS OF ONE PATENTEE, WHILE IN ANOTHER CASE HE WAS FREED FROM ANXIETY BY THE PATENT BEING ALLOWED TO LAPSE IN 1859 THROUGH NON-PAYMENT OF FEES."

248 " ANOTHER IS-BE WHO DID THIS WAS ALEXANDER BELL..."
"AS IS SOMETIMES COMMON IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES, SIMULTANEOUS DEVELOPMENTS CAN OCCUR, AS EVIDENCED BY A NUMBER OF INVENTORS WHO WERE AT WORK ON THE TELEPHONE.


ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL (3 MARCH 1847 - 2 AUGUST 1922) WAS AN EMINENT SCIENTIST, INVENTOR AND INNOVATOR WHO IS CREDITED WITH THE INVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE. HIS FATHER, GRANDFATHER AND BROTHER HAD ALL BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WORK ON ELOCUTION AND SPEECH, AND BOTH HIS MOTHER AND WIFE WERE DEAF, PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCING BELL'S LIFE'S WORK. HIS RESEARCH ON HEARING AND SPEECH FURTHER LED HIM TO EXPERIMENT WITH HEARING DEVICES THAT EVENTUALLY CULMINATED IN BELL BEING AWARDED THE FIRST U.S. PATENT FOR THE INVENTION OF THE TELEPHONE IN 1876.


IN REFLECTION, BELL CONSIDERED HIS MOST FAMOUS INVENTION AN INTRUSION ON HIS REAL WORK AS A SCIENTIST AND REFUSED TO HAVE A TELEPHONE IN HIS STUDY."

249 ..." IT WAS INVENTED BY SEVERAL OTHERS, INCLUDING ELISHA GRAY."
"ELISHA GRAY (AUGUST 2, 1835 - JANUARY 21, 1901) WAS AN AMERICAN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND IS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS DEVELOPMENT OF A TELEPHONE PROTOTYPE IN 1876 IN HIGHLAND PARK, ILLINOIS, U.S.A.. MR. ELISHA GRAY, OF CHICAGO ALSO DEVISED A TONE TELEGRAPH OF THIS KIND ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS HERR LA COUR. IN THIS APPARATUS A VIBRATING STEEL REED INTERRUPTED THE CURRENT, WHICH AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE PASSED THROUGH AN ELECTROMAGNET AND VIBRATED A MATCHING STEEL REED NEAR ITS POLES. GRAY'S 'HARMONIC TELEGRAPH,' WITH THE VIBRATING REEDS, WAS USED BY THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.

 

SINCE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VIBRATIONS — THAT IS TO SAY, MORE THAN ONE NOTE — CAN BE SENT OVER THE SAME WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE HARMONIC TELEGRAPH CAN BE UTILIZED AS A 'MULTIPLEX' OR MANY-PLY TELEGRAPH, CONVEYING SEVERAL MESSAGES THROUGH THE SAME WIRE AT ONCE; AND THESE CAN EITHER BE READ BY THE OPERATOR BY THE SOUND, OR A PERMANENT RECORD CAN BE MADE BY THE MARKS DRAWN ON A RIBBON OF TRAVELLING PAPER BY A MORSE RECORDER. BELL'S MARCH 10, 1876 LABORATORY NOTEBOOK ENTRY DESCRIBING HIS FIRST SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT WITH THE TELEPHONE.


BELL'S PATENT APPLICATION FOR THE TELEPHONE WAS FILED IN THE US PATENT OFFICE ON FEBRUARY 14, 1876. THE USUAL STORY SAYS THAT BELL GOT TO THE PATENT OFFICE AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE HIS RIVAL ELISHA GRAY, AND THAT GRAY LOST HIS RIGHTS TO THE TELEPHONE AS A RESULT.


ACCORDING TO GRAY'S ACCOUNT, HIS PATENT CAVEAT WAS TAKEN TO THE US PATENT OFFICE A FEW HOURS BEFORE BELL'S APPLICATION, SHORTLY AFTER THE PATENT OFFICE OPENED AND REMAINED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE IN-BASKET UNTIL THAT AFTERNOON. BELL'S APPLICATION WAS FILED SHORTLY BEFORE NOON ON 14 FEBRUARY BY BELL'S LAWYER WHO REQUESTED THAT THE FILING FEE BE ENTERED IMMEDIATELY ONTO THE CASH RECEIPTS BLOTTER AND THAT BELL'S APPLICATION BE TAKEN TO THE EXAMINER IMMEDIATELY.

 

LATE THAT AFTERNOON, THE FEE FOR GRAY'S CAVEAT WAS ENTERED ON THE CASH BLOTTER AND THE CAVEAT WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE EXAMINER UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE FACT THAT BELL'S FILING FEE WAS RECORDED EARLIER THAN GRAY'S FEE LED TO THE STORY THAT BELL HAD ARRIVED AT THE PATENT OFFICE EARLIER. BELL WAS IN BOSTON ON FEBRUARY 14 AND DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS HAPPENING UNTIL HE ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON ON FEBRUARY 26.

 

WHETHER BELL'S APPLICATION WAS FILED BEFORE OR AFTER GRAY'S CAVEAT NO LONGER MATTERED, BECAUSE GRAY ABANDONED HIS CAVEAT, WHICH OPENED THE DOOR TO BELL BEING GRANTED U.S. PATENT 174,465_ FOR THE TELEPHONE ON 7 MARCH 1876."
