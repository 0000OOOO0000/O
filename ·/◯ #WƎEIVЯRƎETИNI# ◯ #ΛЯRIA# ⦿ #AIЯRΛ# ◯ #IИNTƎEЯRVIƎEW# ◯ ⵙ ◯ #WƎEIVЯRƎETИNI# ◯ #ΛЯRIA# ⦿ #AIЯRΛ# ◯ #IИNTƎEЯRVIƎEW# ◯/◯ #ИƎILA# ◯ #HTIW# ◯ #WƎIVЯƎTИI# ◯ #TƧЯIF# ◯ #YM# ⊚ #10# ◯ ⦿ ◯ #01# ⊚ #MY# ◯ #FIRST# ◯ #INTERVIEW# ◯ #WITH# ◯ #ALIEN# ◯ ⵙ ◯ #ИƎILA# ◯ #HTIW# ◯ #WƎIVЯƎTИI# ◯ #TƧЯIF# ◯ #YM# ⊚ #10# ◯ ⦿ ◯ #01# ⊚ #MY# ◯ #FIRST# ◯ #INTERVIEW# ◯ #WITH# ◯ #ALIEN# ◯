CHAPTER ONE - MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH THE ALIEN

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"BY THE TIME THE ALIEN HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THE BASE I HAD ALREADY SPENT SEVERAL HOURS WITH HER. AS I MENTIONED, MR. CAVITT TOLD ME TO STAY WITH THE ALIEN, SINCE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON AMONG US WHO COULD UNDERSTAND HER COMMUNICATION. I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MY ABILITY TO "COMMUNICATE" WITH THE BEING. I HAD NEVER BEFORE THAT TIME EXPERIENCED TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE.


THE NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION I EXPERIENCED WAS LIKE THE UNDERSTANDING YOU MIGHT HAVE WHEN A CHILD OR A DOG IS TRYING TO GET YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, BUT MUCH, MUCH MORE DIRECT AND POWERFUL! EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE NO "WORDS" SPOKEN, OR SIGNS MADE, THE INTENTION OF THE THOUGHTS WERE UNMISTAKABLE TO ME. I REALIZED LATER THAT, ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED THE THOUGHT, I DID NOT NECESSARILY INTERPRET IT'S MEANING EXACTLY.


I THINK THAT THE ALIEN BEING WAS NOT WILLING TO DISCUSS TECHNICAL MATTERS, DUE TO THE NATURE OF HER POSITION AS AN OFFICER AND PILOT WITH THE DUTY TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIRED BY HER OWN "UNIT" OR ORGANIZATION. ANY SOLDIER WHO IS CAPTURED BY THE "ENEMY" IN THE LINE OF DUTY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO WITHHOLD VITAL INFORMATION, EVEN IN THE FACE OF INTERROGATION OR TORTURE, OF COURSE.


BUT, IN SPITE OF THAT, I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE ALIEN BEING WAS NOT REALLY TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM ME. I JUST NEVER GOT THAT FEELING. HER COMMUNICATION ALWAYS SEEMED HONEST AND SINCERE TO ME. BUT, I SUPPOSE YOU CAN NEVER KNOW FOR SURE. I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT I SHARED A UNIQUE "BOND" WITH THE ALIEN. IT WAS A KIND OF "TRUST" OR EMPATHY THAT YOU HAVE WITH A PATIENT, OR A CHILD. I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE ALIEN COULD UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN "HER" AND HAD NO HARMFUL INTENTION, NOR WOULD I ALLOW ANY HARM TO COME TO HER, IF I COULD PREVENT IT. THIS WAS TRUE TOO.
 

I REFER TO THE ALIEN AS "HER". ACTUALLY, THE BEING WAS NOT SEXUAL IN ANY WAY, EITHER PHYSIOLOGICALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY. "SHE" DID HAVE A RATHER STRONG, FEMININE PRESENCE AND DEMEANOR. HOWEVER, IN TERMS OF PHYSIOLOGY, THE BEING WAS "ASEXUAL" AND HAD NO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. HER BODY WAS MORE LIKE THE BODY OF A "DOLL" OR "ROBOT". THERE WERE NO INTERNAL "ORGANS", AS THE BODY WAS NOT CONSTRUCTED OF BIOLOGICAL CELLS. IT DID HAVE A KIND OF "CIRCUIT" SYSTEM OR ELECTRICAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT RAN THROUGHOUT THE BODY, BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKED.


IN STATURE AND APPEARANCE THE BODY WAS QUITE SHORT AND PETITE. ABOUT A 40 INCHES TALL. THE HEAD WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE, RELATIVE TO ARMS, LEGS AND TORSO, WHICH WHERE THIN. THERE WERE THREE "FINGERS" ON EACH OF TWO" HANDS" AND "FEET" WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT PREHENSILE. 22 (FOOTNOTE) THE HEAD HAD NO OPERATIONAL "NOSE" OR "MOUTH" OR "EARS". I UNDERSTOOD THAT A SPACE OFFICER DOES NOT NEED THESE AS SPACE HAS NO ATMOSPHERE TO CONDUCT SOUND. THEREFORE, SOUND RELATED SENSORY ORGANS ARE NOT BUILT INTO THE BODY. NOR DOES THE BODY NEED TO CONSUME FOOD, HENCE, THE ABSENCE OF A MOUTH.


THE EYES WERE QUITE LARGE. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT DEGREE OF VISUAL ACUITY OF WHICH THE EYES WERE CAPABLE, BUT I OBSERVED THAT HER SENSE OF SIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ACUTE. I THINK THE LENSES OF THE EYES, WHICH WERE VERY DARK AND OPAQUE, MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETECT WAVES OR PARTICLES BEYOND THE VISUAL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT. 23 (FOOTNOTE) I SUSPECT THAT THIS MAY HAVE INCLUDED THE FULL RANGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM, 24 (FOOTNOTE) OR MORE, BUT I DO NOT KNOW THIS FOR SURE.


WHEN THE BEING LOOKED AT ME HER GAZE SEEMED TO PENETRATE RIGHT THROUGH ME, AS THOUGH SHE HAD "X-RAY VISION". 25 (FOOTNOTE) I FOUND THIS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING, AT FIRST, UNTIL I REALIZED THAT SHE HAD NO SEXUAL INTENTIONS. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK SHE EVER EVEN HAD THE THOUGHT THAT I WAS MALE OR FEMALE.


IT BECOME VERY OBVIOUS AFTER A SHORT TIME WITH THE BEING THAT HER BODY DID NOT REQUIRE OXYGEN, FOOD OR WATER OR ANY OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCE OF NUTRITION OR ENERGY. AS I LEARNED LATER, THIS BEING SUPPLIED HER OWN "ENERGY", WHICH ANIMATED AND OPERATED THE BODY. IT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT EERIE AT FIRST, BUT I GOT USED TO THE IDEA. IT'S REALLY A VERY, VERY SIMPLE BODY. THERE IS NOT MUCH TO IT, COMPARED TO OUR OWN BODIES.


AIRL EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT MECHANICAL, LIKE A ROBOT, NOR WAS IT BIOLOGICAL. IT IS ANIMATED DIRECTLY BY HER AS A SPIRITUAL BEING. TECHNICALLY, FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT, I WOULD SAY THAT AIRL'S BODY COULD NOT EVEN BE CALLED "ALIVE". HER "DOLL" BODY IS NOT A BIOLOGICAL LIFE FORM, 26 (FOOTNOTE) WITH CELLS, AND SO FORTH.


IT HAD A SMOOTH SKIN, OR COVERING WHICH WAS GRAY IN COLOR. THE BODY WAS HIGHLY TOLERANT TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE, ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, AND PRESSURE. THE LIMBS WERE QUITE FRAIL, WITHOUT MUSCULATURE. IN SPACE THERE IS NO GRAVITY, 27 (FOOTNOTE) SO VERY LITTLE MUSCLE STRENGTH IS NEEDED. THE BODY WAS USED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SPACE CRAFT OR IN LOW, OR NO-GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS. SINCE EARTH HAS A HEAVY GRAVITY, THE BODY WAS NOT ABLE TO WALK AROUND VERY WELL AS THE LEGS WERE NOT REALLY SUITED TO THAT PURPOSE. THE FEET AND HANDS WERE QUITE FLEXIBLE AND AGILE HOWEVER.


OVER NIGHT, BEFORE MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH THE ALIEN, THE AREA HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A BUZZING HIVE OF ACTIVITY. THERE WERE A DOZEN MEN WORKING ON SETTING UP LIGHTS AND CAMERA EQUIPMENT. A MOTION PICTURE CAMERA AND MICROPHONE AND A TAPE RECORDER WAS THERE ALSO SET UP IN THE "INTERVIEW ROOM". (I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY A MICROPHONE WAS NEEDED, SINCE THERE WAS NO VERBAL COMMUNICATION POSSIBLE WITH THE ALIEN.) THERE WAS ALSO A STENOGRAPHER 28 (FOOTNOTE) AND SEVERAL PEOPLE BUSILY TYPING ON TYPEWRITERS.


I WAS INFORMED THAT AN EXPERT FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER AND A "CODE BREAKING" TEAM HAD BEEN FLOWN TO THE BASE DURING THE NIGHT TO ASSIST WITH MY EFFORTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN. THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL MEDICAL PERSONNEL -SPECIALISTS IN VARIOUS FIELDS - TO EXAMINE THE ALIEN. AND, A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY WAS THERE TO HELP FORMULATE QUESTIONS AND "INTERPRET" THE ANSWERS. AS I WAS JUST A NURSE, I WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A "QUALIFIED" INTERPRETER, EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THE ALIEN WAS THINKING!


THERE WERE MANY SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN US. EACH "INTERVIEW" RESULTED IN AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US, AS I WILL DISCUSS LATER ON IN MY NOTES. THIS IS THE FIRST TRANSCRIPT WITH THE ANSWERS TO A LIST OF QUESTIONS PROVIDED TO ME BY THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AT THE BASE WHICH I DEBRIEFED TO THE STENOGRAPHER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INTERVIEW."
 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)
TOP SECRET
OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD, 50 9TH BOMB GROUP

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 9. 7. 1947

 

"QUESTION - "ARE YOU INJURED?"
ANSWER -NO
QUESTION - "WHAT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DO YOU REQUIRE?"
ANSWER -NONE
QUESTION - "DO NEED FOOD OR WATER OR OTHER SUSTENANCE?"
ANSWER -NO
QUESTION - "DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS, SUCH AS AIR TEMPERATURE, ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL CONTENT, AIR PRESSURE, OR WASTE ELIMINATION?"
ANSWER -
NO. I AM NOT A BIOLOGICAL BEING.
QUESTION - "DOES YOUR BODY OR SPACE CRAFT CARRY ANY GERMS OR CONTAMINATION THAT MAY BE HARMFUL TO HUMANS OR OTHER EARTH LIFE FORMS?"
ANSWER -
NO GERMS IN SPACE.
QUESTION - "DOES YOUR GOVERNMENT KNOW YOU ARE HERE?"
ANSWER -
NOT AT THIS TIME
QUESTION - "ARE OTHERS OF YOUR KIND GOING TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU?"
ANSWER -
YES
QUESTION - "WHAT IS THE WEAPONS CAPABILITY OF YOUR PEOPLE?"
ANSWER -
VERY DESTRUCTIVE.


I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE EXACT NATURE OF THE KIND OF ARMS OR WEAPONS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE, BUT I DID NOT FEEL THAT THERE WAS ANY MALEVOLENT INTENTION IN HER REPLY, JUST A STATEMENT OF FACT.


QUESTION - "WHY DID YOUR SPACE CRAFT CRASH?" ANSWER -
IT WAS STRUCK BY AN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CAUSED US TO LOSE CONTROL.
QUESTION - "WHY WAS YOUR SPACE CRAFT IN THIS AREA?"
ANSWER -
INVESTIGATION OF "BURNING CLOUDS" / RADIATION /
EXPLOSIONS 29 (FOOTNOTE)
QUESTION - "HOW DOES YOUR SPACE CRAFT FLY?" ANSWER -
IT IS CONTROLLED THROUGH "MIND". RESPONDS TO "THOUGHT COMMANDS".


"MIND" OR "THOUGHT COMMAND" ARE THE ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE WORDS I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE THE THOUGHT. THEIR BODIES, AND I THINK, THE SPACE CRAFT, ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THEM THROUGH SOME KIND OF ELECTRICAL "NERVOUS SYSTEM" THAT THEY CONTROL WITH THEIR OWN THOUGHTS.


QUESTION - "HOW DO YOUR PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER?"
ANSWER -
THROUGH MIND /THOUGHT.


THE WORDS "MIND" AND "THOUGHT" COMBINED TOGETHER ARE THE CLOSEST ENGLISH LANGUAGE WORDS I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE THE IDEA AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THEY COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY FROM THE MIND, JUST AS SHE IS COMMUNICATING WITH ME.


QUESTION - "DO YOU HAVE A WRITTEN LANGUAGE OR SYMBOLS FOR COMMUNICATION?"
ANSWER -YES
QUESTION - "WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?"

ANSWER -
THE HOME / BIRTHPLACE WORLD OF THE DOMAIN


SINCE I AM NOT AN ASTRONOMER, I HAVE NO WAY OF THINKING IN TERMS OF STARS, GALAXIES, CONSTELLATIONS AND DIRECTIONS IN SPACE. THE IMPRESSION I RECEIVED WAS OF A PLANET IN THE CENTER OF A HUGE CLUSTER OF GALAXIES THAT IS TO HER LIKE "HOME", OR "BIRTHPLACE". THE WORD "DOMAIN" IS THE CLOSEST WORD I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE HER CONCEPT, IMAGES AND THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE SHE IS FROM. IT COULD AS EASILY BE CALLED THE "TERRITORY" OR THE "REALM". HOWEVER, I AM SURE THAT IT WAS NOT JUST A PLANET OR A SOLAR SYSTEM OR A CLUSTER OF STARS, BUT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF GALAXIES!


QUESTION - "WILL YOUR GOVERNMENT SEND REPRESENTATIVES TO MEET WITH OUR LEADERS?"
ANSWER -NO
QUESTION - "WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS CONCERNING
EARTH?" ANSWER -
PRESERVE / PROTECT PROPERTY OF THE DOMAIN QUESTION - "WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT EARTH GOVERNMENTS AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS?"
ANSWER -
POOR / SMALL. DESTROY PLANET.
QUESTION - "WHY HAVEN'T YOUR PEOPLE MADE YOUR EXISTENCE KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH?"
ANSWER -
WATCH / OBSERVE. NO CONTACT.


I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT CONTACT WITH PEOPLE ON EARTH WAS NOT PERMITTED, BUT I COULD NOT THINK OF A WORD OR IDEA THAT COMMUNICATED THE IMPRESSION I GOT EXACTLY. THEY ARE JUST OBSERVING US.


QUESTION - "HAVE YOUR PEOPLE VISITED EARTH'S PREVIOUSLY?"
ANSWER -
PERIODIC / REPEATING OBSERVATIONS.
QUESTION - "HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ABOUT EARTH?"
ANSWER -
LONG BEFORE HUMANS.


I AM NOT SURE IF THE WORD "PREHISTORIC" WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE HUMAN BEINGS EVOLVED.


QUESTION - "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION ON EARTH?"
ANSWER -
SMALL INTEREST / ATTENTION. SMALL TIME.


THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION SEEMED VERY VAGUE TO ME. HOWEVER, I PERCEIVED THAT HER INTEREST IN EARTH HISTORY IS NOT VERY STRONG OR THAT SHE DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. OR, MAYBE, ... I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALLY GET AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION.


QUESTION - "CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR HOME WORLD TO US?"
ANSWER -
PLACE OF CIVILIZATION / CULTURE / HISTORY. LARGE PLANET. WEALTH / RESOURCES ALWAYS. ORDER. POWER.
KNOWLEDGE / WISDOM. TWO STARS. THREE MOONS.
QUESTION - "WHAT IS THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR CIVILIZATION?"
ANSWER -
ANCIENT. TRILLIONS OF YEARS. ALWAYS. ABOVE ALL OTHERS. PLAN. SCHEDULE. PROGRESS. WIN. HIGH GOALS / IDEAS.


I USE THE NUMBER "TRILLIONS" 30 (FOOTNOTE) BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT THE MEANING WAS A NUMBER LARGER THAN MANY BILLIONS. THE IDEA OF THE LENGTH OF TIME SHE COMMUNICATED IS BEYOND ME. IT'S REALLY CLOSER TO THE IDEA OF "INFINITY" IN TERMS OF EARTH YEARS.


QUESTION - "DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?"
ANSWER -
WE THINK. IT IS. MAKE IT CONTINUE. ALWAYS.


I AM SURE THAT THE ALIEN BEING DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF "GOD" OR "WORSHIP" AS WE DO. I ASSUME THAT THE PEOPLE IN HER CIVILIZATION WERE ALL ATHEISTS. MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THEMSELVES AND ARE VERY PRIDEFUL INDEED!


QUESTION - "WHAT TYPE OF SOCIETY DO YOU HAVE?"
ANSWER -
ORDER. POWER. FUTURE ALWAYS. CONTROL. GROW.


THESE ARE THE CLOSEST WORDS I COULD USE TO DESCRIBE THE IDEA SHE HAD ABOUT HER OWN SOCIETY OR CIVILIZATION. HER "EMOTION" WHEN COMMUNICATING HER RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION BECAME VERY INTENSE, VERY BRIGHT AND EMPHATIC! HER THOUGHT WAS FILLED WITH AN EMOTION THAT GAVE ME A FEELING OF JUBILATION OR JOY. BUT, IT MADE ME VERY NERVOUS ALSO.


QUESTION - "ARE THERE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS BESIDES YOURSELF IN THE UNIVERSE?"
ANSWER -
EVERYWHERE. WE ARE GREATEST / HIGHEST OF ALL.


DUE TO HER SMALL STATURE, I AM SURE THAT SHE DID NOT MEAN "TALLEST" OR "BIGGEST". AGAIN, HER PRIDEFUL "NATURE" SHOWED THROUGH IN THE FEELING I RECEIVED FROM HER."

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST INTERVIEW. WHEN THE ANSWERS TO THE FIRST LIST OF QUESTIONS WERE TYPED AND GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR THEM, THEY WERE VERY EXCITED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET THE ALIEN TO SAY ANYTHING!


HOWEVER, AFTER THEY FINISHED READING MY ANSWERS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY. NOW THEY HAD A LOT OF NEW QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF THE ANSWERS I RECEIVED TO THE FIRST LIST OF QUESTIONS.


AN OFFICER TOLD ME TO AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. I WAITED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE ADJOINING OFFICE. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CONTINUE MY "INTERVIEW" WITH THE ALIEN. HOWEVER, I WAS ALWAYS WELL TREATED AND ALLOWED TO EAT AND SLEEP AND USE THE RESTROOM FACILITIES WHENEVER I WANTED.


EVENTUALLY, A NEW LIST OF QUESTIONS WAS WRITTEN FOR ME TO ASK THE ALIEN. I GATHERED THAT QUITE A FEW OTHER AGENTS, GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY OFFICIALS HAD ARRIVED AT THE BASE BY THIS TIME. THEY TOLD ME THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE IN THE ROOM WITH ME DURING THE NEXT INTERVIEW SO THEY COULD PROMPT ME TO ASK FOR MORE DETAILS DURING THE INTERVIEW. HOWEVER, WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW WITH THESE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, I RECEIVED NO THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS OR ANY OTHER PERCEPTIBLE COMMUNICATION FROM THE ALIEN. NOTHING. THE ALIEN JUST SAT IN A CHAIR WITHOUT MOVING.


WE ALL LEFT THE INTERVIEW ROOM. THE INTELLIGENCE AGENT BECAME VERY AGITATED ABOUT THIS. HE ACCUSED ME OF LYING OR MAKING UP THE ANSWERS TO THE FIRST QUESTIONS. I INSISTED THAT MY ANSWERS WERE HONEST, AND AS ACCURATE AS I COULD MAKE THEM!


LATER THAT DAY, IT WAS DECIDED THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WOULD ATTEMPT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE ALIEN. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF SEVERAL ATTEMPTS BY DIFFERENT "EXPERTS", NO ONE ELSE WAS EVER ABLE TO GET ANY COMMUNICATION AT ALL FROM THE ALIEN.


OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS A PSYCHIC RESEARCH SCIENTIST FROM BACK EAST WAS FLOWN TO THE BASE TO INTERVIEW THE ALIEN. HER NAME WAS GERTRUDE SOMETHING OR OTHER. I DON'T RECALL THE LAST NAME. 31 (FOOTNOTE) ON ANOTHER OCCASION AN INDIAN CLAIRVOYANT NAMED KRISHNAMURTI 32 (FOOTNOTE) CAME TO THE BASE TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN . NEITHER ONE WAS SUCCESSFUL AT GETTING THE ALIEN TO COMMUNICATE ANYTHING. I WAS PERSONALLY NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY WITH EITHER OF THESE PEOPLE EITHER, ALTHOUGH I DID THINK THAT MR. KRISHNAMURTI WAS A VERY KIND AND INTELLIGENT GENTLEMAN.


FINALLY, IT WAS DECIDED THAT I SHOULD BE LEFT WITH THE ALIEN BY MYSELF TO SEE IF I COULD GET ANY ANSWERS."

 

 

FOOTNOTES

22 "...PREHENSILE..."
THE WORD IS DERIVED FROM THE LATIN TERM PREHENDERE, MEANING "TO GRASP." IT IS THE QUALITY OF AN ORGAN THAT HAS ADAPTED FOR GRASPING OR HOLDING. EXAMPLES OF PREHENSILE BODY PARTS INCLUDE THE TAILS OF NEW WORLD MONKEYS AND OPOSSUMS, THE TRUNKS OF ELEPHANTS, THE TONGUES OF GIRAFFES, THE LIPS OF HORSES AND THE PROBOSCIDES OF TAPIR. THE HANDS OF PRIMATES ARE ALL PREHENSILE TO VARYING DEGREES, AND MANY SPECIES (EVEN A FEW HUMANS) HAVE PREHENSILE FEET AS WELL. THE CLAWS OF CATS ARE ALSO PREHENSILE. MANY EXTANT LIZARDS HAVE PREHENSILE TAILS (GECKOS, CHAMELEONS, AND A SPECIES OF SKINK). THE FOSSIL RECORD SHOWS PREHENSILE TAILS IN LIZARDS (SIMIOSAURIA) GOING BACK MANY MILLION YEARS TO THE TRIASSIC PERIOD.


PREHENSILITY IS AN EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION THAT HAS AFFORDED SPECIES A GREAT NATURAL ADVANTAGE IN MANIPULATING THEIR ENVIRONMENT FOR FEEDING, DIGGING, AND DEFENSE. IT ENABLES MANY ANIMALS, SUCH AS PRIMATES, TO USE TOOLS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE TASKS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HIGHLY SPECIALIZED ANATOMY. FOR EXAMPLE, CHIMPANZEES HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE STICKS TO FISH FOR TERMITES AND GRUBS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL PREHENSILE ORGANS ARE APPLIED TO TOOL USE- THE GIRAFFE TONGUE, FOR INSTANCE, IS INSTEAD USED IN FEEDING AND SELF-CLEANING BEHAVIORS."

23 "... ABLE TO DETECT WAVES OR PARTICLES BEYOND THE VISUAL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT."


THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM (OR SOMETIMES CALLED THE OPTICAL SPECTRUM) IS THE PORTION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM THAT IS VISIBLE TO (CAN BE DETECTED BY) THE HUMAN EYE. ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IN THIS RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS IS CALLED VISIBLE LIGHT OR SIMPLY LIGHT. A TYPICAL HUMAN EYE WILL RESPOND TO WAVELENGTHS IN AIR FROM ABOUT 380 TO 750 NM. THE CORRESPONDING WAVELENGTHS IN WATER AND OTHER MEDIA ARE REDUCED BY A FACTOR EQUAL TO THE REFRACTIVE INDEX. IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY, THIS CORRESPONDS TO A BAND IN THE VICINITY OF 400-790 TERAHERTZ. A LIGHT-ADAPTED EYE GENERALLY HAS ITS MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY AT AROUND 555 NM (540 THZ), IN THE GREEN REGION OF THE OPTICAL SPECTRUM. THE SPECTRUM DOES NOT, HOWEVER, CONTAIN ALL THE CORBRS THAT THE HUMAN EYES AND BRAIN CAN DISTINGUISH. BROWN, PINK, AND MAGENTA ARE ABSENT, FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THEY NEED A MIX OF MULTIPLE WAVELENGTHS, PREFERABLY SHADES OF RED.


WAVELENGTHS VISIBLE TO THE EYE ALSO PASS THROUGH THE "OPTICAL WINDOW", THE REGION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM WHICH PASSES LARGELY UNATTENUATED THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE (ALTHOUGH BLUE LIGHT IS SCATTERED MORE THAN RED LIGHT, WHICH IS THE REASON THE SKY IS BLUE). THE RESPONSE OF THE HUMAN EYE IS DEFINED BY SUBJECTIVE TESTING, BUT THE ATMOSPHERIC WINDOWS ARE DEFINED BY PHYSICAL MEASUREMENT. THE "VISIBLE WINDOW" IS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT OVERLAPS THE HUMAN VISIBLE RESPONSE SPECTRUM; THE NEAR INFRARED WINDOWS LIE JUST OUT OF HUMAN RESPONSE WINDOW, AND THE MEDIUM WAVELENGTH AND LONG WAVELENGTH OR FAR INFRARED ARE FAR BEYOND THE HUMAN RESPONSE REGION.


THE EYES OF MANY SPECIES PERCEIVE WAVELENGTHS DIFFERENT FROM THE SPECTRUM VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY INSECTS, SUCH AS BEES, CAN SEE LIGHT IN THE ULTRAVIOLET, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR FINDING NECTAR IN FLOWERS. FOR THIS REASON, PLANT SPECIES WHOSE LIFE CYCLES ARE LINKED TO INSECT POLLINATION MAY OWE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS TO THEIR APPEARANCE IN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT, RATHER THAN HOW COLORFUL THEY APPEAR TO OUR EYES."

24"... THIS MAY HAVE INCLUDED THE FULL RANGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM..."
"THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM IS THE RANGE OF ALL POSSIBLE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION. THE "ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM" (USUALLY JUST SPECTRUM) OF AN OBJECT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION FROM THAT OBJECT.


THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM EXTENDS FROM BELOW THE FREQUENCIES USED FOR MODEM RADIO (AT THE LONG-WAVELENGTH END) THROUGH GAMMA RADIATION (AT THE SHORT-WAVELENGTH END), COVERING WAVELENGTHS FROM THOUSANDS OF KILOMETRES DOWN TO A FRACTION THE SIZE OF AN ATOM. IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE SHORT WAVELENGTH LIMIT IS THE VICINITY OF THE PLANCK LENGTH, AND THE LONG WAVELENGTH LIMIT IS THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF, ALTHOUGH IN PRINCIPLE THE SPECTRUM IS INFINITE AND CONTINUOUS."

25"... HER GAZE SEEMED TO PENETRATE RIGHT THROUGH ME, AS THOUGH SHE HAD "X-RAY VISION".
"IN FICTIONAL STORIES, X-RAY VISION HAS GENERALLY BEEN PORTRAYED AS THE ABILITY TO SEE THROUGH LAYERS OF OBJECTS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE HOLDER OF THIS SUPERPOWER. PEOPLE OFTEN PRETEND TO HAVE THIS ABILITY THROUGH THE USE OF X-RAY GLASSES, WHICH ARE A SPECIAL TYPE OF "JOKE-AROUND" OR PRANK-GAG TOYS WITH THE SECRET OF ITS "X-RAY PROPERTIES" BEING UNKNOWN. THE GOAL IS USUALLY TO SEE THROUGH CLOTHING, USUALLY TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, BUT SOMETIMES FOR PURPOSE OF SEEING A PERSON'S PRIVATE PARTS. IN THE NON-FICTIONAL REALM, X-RAYS HAVE MANY PRACTICAL USES IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. WHILE THERE ARE DEVICES CURRENTLY EXTANT WHICH CAN "SEE" THROUGH CLOTHING (USING TERAHERTZ WAVES), MOST ARE QUITE BULKY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NIGHT VISION EQUIPPED VIDEO CAMERAS THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO SEE THROUGH CLOTHING AT A FREQUENCY JUST BELOW VISIBLE LIGHT."

26 ..."TECHNICALLY, FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT, I WOULD SAY THAT AID'S BODY COULD NOT EVEN BE CALLED "ALIVE". "


"THE WORD "ORGANISM" MAY BROADLY BE DEFINED AS AN ASSEMBLY OF MOLECULES THAT FUNCTION AS A MORE OR LESS STABLE WHOLE AND HAS THE PROPERTIES OF LIFE. HOWEVER, MANY SOURCES, LEXICAL AND SCIENTIFIC, ADD CONDITIONS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC TO DEFINING THE WORD.


THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY DEFINES AN ORGANISM AS "[AN] INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL, PLANT, OR SINGLE-CELLED LIFE FORM" THIS DEFINITION PROBLEMATICALLY EXCLUDES NON-ANIMAL AND PLANT MULTICELLULAR LIFE FORMS SUCH AS SOME FUNGI AND PROTISTA. LESS CONTROVERSIALLY, PERHAPS, IT EXCLUDES VIRUSES AND THEORETICALLY-POSSIBLE MAN-MADE NON-ORGANIC LIFE FORMS.


CHAMBERS ONLINE REFERENCE PROVIDES A MUCH BROADER DEFINITION: "ANY LIVING STRUCTURE, SUCH AS A PLANT, ANIMAL, FUNGUS OR BACTERIUM, CAPABLE OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION". THE DEFINITION "ANY LIFE FORM CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT REPRODUCTION, ORGANIC OR OTHERWISE" WOULD ENCOMPASS ALL CELLULAR LIFE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF SYNTHETIC LIFE CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT REPRODUCTION, BUT WOULD EXCLUDE VIRUSES, WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON THE BIOCHEMICAL MACHINERY OF A HOST CELL FOR REPRODUCTION. SOME MAY USE A DEFINITION THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE VIRUSES."

27 "...IN SPACE THERE IS NOT GRAVITY..."
"THE TERMS GRAVITATION AND GRAVITY ARE MOSTLY INTERCHANGEABLE IN EVERYDAY USE, BUT IN SCIENTIFIC USAGE A DISTINCTION MAY HE MADE. "GRAVITATION" IS A GENERAL TERM DESCRIBING THE ATTRACTIVE INFLUENCE THAT ALL OBJECTS WITH MASS EXERT ON EACH OTHER, WHILE "GRAVITY" SPECIFICALLY REFERS TO A FORCE THAT IS SUPPOSED IN SOME THEORIES (SUCH AS NEWTON'S) TO BE THE CAUSE OF THIS ATTRACTION. BY CONTRAST, IN GENERAL RELATIVITY GRAVITATION IS DUE TO SPACE-TIME CURVATURES THAT CAUSE INERTIALLY MOVING OBJECTS TO ACCELERATE TOWARDS EACH OTHER.


ISAAC NEWTON'S THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION IS A PHYSICAL LAW DESCRIBING THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN BODIES WITH MASS. IT IS A PART OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND WAS FIRST FORMULATED IN NEWTON'S WORK PHILOSOPHIAE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA. PUBLISHED IN 1687. IN MODEM LANGUAGE IT STATES THE FOLLOWING:


EVERY POINT MASS ATTRACTS EVERY OTHER POINT MASS BY A FORCE POINTING ALONG THE LINE INTERSECTING BOTH POINTS. THE FORCE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRODUCT OF THE TWO MASSES AND INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POINT MASSES:

WHERE:
• F - IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINT MASSES,
• G - IS THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT
• M1 - IS THE MASS OF THE FIRST POINT MASS,
• M2 - IS THE MASS OF THE SECOND POINT MASS,
• R - IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINT MASSES."

28 "...STENOGRAPHER..."
"SHORTHAND IS AN ABBREVIATED AND/OR SYMBOLIC WRITING METHOD THAT INCREASES SPEED OR BREVITY OF WRITING AS COMPARED TO A NORMAL METHOD OF WRITING A LANGUAGE. THE PROCESS OF WRITING IN SHORTHAND IS CALLED STENOGRAPHY, FROM THE GREEK STENOS (NARROW) AND GRAPHE (WRITING). IT HAS ALSO BEEN CALLED BRACHYGRAPHY, FROM GREEK BRACHYS (SHORT) AND TACHYGRAPHY, FROM GREEK TACHYS (SWIFT, SPEEDY), DEPENDING ON WHETHER COMPRESSION OR SPEED OF WRITING IS THE GOAL. MANY FORMS OF SHORTHAND EXIST. A TYPICAL SHORTHAND SYSTEM PROVIDES SYMBOLS OR ABBREVIATIONS FOR WORDS AND COMMON PHRASES, WHICH ALLOW SOMEONE WELL TRAINED IN THE SYSTEM TO WRITE AS QUICKLY AS PEOPLE SPEAK. SHORTHAND WAS USED MORE WIDELY IN THE PAST, BEFORE THE INVENTION OF RECORDING AND DICTATION MACHINES."

29 "... INVESTIGATION OF "BURNING CLOUDS" / RADIATION / EXPLOSIONS..."
"JULY 16,1945..." - THE FIRST TEST OF A NUCLEAR DEVICE WAS MADE IN THE DESERT NORTH OF ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO. ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO IS ONLY 117 MILES FROM ALAMOGORDO.

NOTE: IN 1932 THAT BRITISH EXPLORERS IN MODEL-A FORDS FIRST VISITED THIS AREA OF WESTERN EGYPT, WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A MYSTERIOUS YELLOW-GREEN GLASS SCATTERED ACROSS THE SURFACE. EVER SINCE, LIBYAN DESERT GLASS HAS FASCINATED SCIENTISTS, WHO HAVE DREAMED UP ALL SORTS OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW IT COULD HAVE FORMED.

 

IT'S TOO SILICA RICH TO BE VOLCANIC. IN SOME WAYS IT RESEMBLES THE TEKTITES GENERATED BY THE HIGH PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH ASTEROID IMPACTS. VINCENZO DE MICHELE VISITED THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IN CAIRO, AND NOTICED THAT ONE OF KING TUTANKHAMUN'S JEWELED BREASTPLATES CONTAINED A CARVED SCARAB THAT LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE A PIECE OF THE GLASS.

 

A SIMPLE OPTICAL MEASUREMENT CONFIRMED THE MATCH IN 1998. NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS ARE HOT ENOUGH TO FUSE SURFACE MATERIALS INTO GLASS, MUCH LIKE THE FIRST ATOMIC EXPLOSION GENERATED YELLOW - GREEN GLASS AT THE TRINITY, NEW MEXICO SITE IN 1945. MANY SIMILAR SITES AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPLAINABLE "CATACLYSMIC" EVENTS REVEAL THE SAME YELLOW - GREEN GLASS. THIS "YELLOW-GREEN GLASS" HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN STRATA OF ROCK WHICH CONTAIN DINOSAUR FOSSILS ALL OVER THE WORLD.


JUNE 30, 1947 - "THE EVALUATION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB AS A MILITARY WEAPON", MADE BY THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION WAS RECEIVED BY PRESIDENT TRUMAN.

 

WITH A BRILLIANT FLOURISH OF SUICIDAL LOGIC, THAT ONLY THE MILITARY, POLITICIANS OTHER LUNATICS ARE CAPABLE OF FATHOMING, THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMISSION, BASED ON EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS IN ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN TWO JAPANESE CITIES, AND ON THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, WAS AS FOLLOWS:

"PART III — CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
SECTION ONE - CONCLUSIONS

1. THE BOARD HAS REACHED THE FOLLOWING MAJOR CONCLUSIONS:

(1) IF USED IN NUMBERS, ATOMIC BOMBS NOT ONLY CAN NULLIFY ANY NATION'S MILITARY EFFORT, BUT CAN DEMOLISH ITS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURES AND PREVENT THEIR REESTABLISHMENT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. WITH SUCH WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY IF EMPLOYED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AS, FOR EXAMPLE, PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO DEPOPULATE VAST AREAS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE, LEAVING ONLY VESTIGIAL REMNANTS OF MAN'S MATERIAL WORKS.
 

(2) THE THREAT OF THE UNCONTROLLED USE OF THE ATOMIC BOMB AND OF OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IS A THREAT TO MANKIND AND TO CIVILIZATION. ONLY THE OUTLAWING OF ALL WAR AND THE SETTING UP ON AN ADEQUATE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CAN LIFT THIS THREAT FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.
 

(3) IN THE ABSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GUARANTEES OF ABIDING PEACE, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CONTINUE THE MANUFACTURE AND STOCKPILING OF WEAPONS OF NUCLEAR FISSION AND TO CARRY ON CONTINUOUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN THE MEANS OF THEIR DELIVERY."

30 "...TRILLIONS..."
ONE THOUSAND THOUSAND = ONE MILLION. (1,000,000) ONE THOUSAND MILLION = ONE BILLION. (1,000,000,000) ONE THOUSAND BILLION = ONE TRILLION. (1,000,000,000,000 )


'THE ENGLISH NAMES FOR LARGE NUMBERS ARE COINED FROM THE LATIN NAMES FOR SMALL NUMBERS N BY ADDING THE ENDING -ILLION SUGGESTED BY THE NAME "MILLION." THUS BILLION AND TRILLION ARE COINED FROM THE LATIN PREFIXES HI- (N = 2) AND TRI- (N = 3), RESPECTIVELY.


IN RECENT YEARS, AMERICAN USAGE HAS ERODED THE EUROPEAN NUMBER DEFINITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMERICAN FINANCE, BECAUSE AMERICANS INSIST THAT $1,000,000,000 BE CALLED A BILLION DOLLARS. IN 1974, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRIME MINISTER HAROLD WILSON ANNOUNCED THAT HENCEFORTH "BILLION" WOULD MEAN 10G AND NOT 1012 IN OFFICIAL BRITISH REPORTS AND STATISTICS. ANYONE WHO USES THE WORDS "BILLION" AND 'TRILLION" INTERNATIONALLY SHOULD MAKE CLEAR WHICH MEANING OF THOSE WORDS IS INTENDED."

31 "...HER NAME WAS GERTRUDE SOMETHING OR OTHER..."
THIS WAS PROBABLY GERTRUDE R. SCHMEIDLER, WHO WAS A NOTABLE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND PARAPSYCHOLOGIST AT THE TIME. SHE PUBLISHED JOURNAL ARTICLES AND BOOKS ABOUT HOW VARIOUS FACTORS AND TRAITS AFFECT A PERSON'S EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION (ESP) ABILITIES.
STUDIED THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN PARAPSYCHOLOGY, AND FORMED GROUPS AND INSTITUTES INTERESTED IN THE STUDY OF ESP, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH, THE DUKE UNIVERSITY PARAPSYCHOLOGY LABORATORY, AND THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION, INC.

REFLECTED IN MUCH OF HER RESEARCH IS THE WORK FOR WHICH SCHMEIDLER IS MOST NOTABLE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAPHOR OF THE SHEEP AND GOATS. SHE DETERMINED THROUGH SEVERAL CYCLES OF ESP CARD-GUESSING EXPERIMENTS THAT "SHEEP" (PERSONS WHO BELIEVED THAT SUCCESS WAS POSSIBLE IN ESP TASKS) SCORED HIGHER THAN "GOATS" (THOSE WHO REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS).

CHAPTER ONE - MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH THE ALIEN

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"BY THE TIME THE ALIEN HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THE BASE I HAD ALREADY SPENT SEVERAL HOURS WITH HER. AS I MENTIONED, MR. CAVITT TOLD ME TO STAY WITH THE ALIEN, SINCE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON AMONG US WHO COULD UNDERSTAND HER COMMUNICATION. I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MY ABILITY TO "COMMUNICATE" WITH THE BEING. I HAD NEVER BEFORE THAT TIME EXPERIENCED TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE.


THE NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION I EXPERIENCED WAS LIKE THE UNDERSTANDING YOU MIGHT HAVE WHEN A CHILD OR A DOG IS TRYING TO GET YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, BUT MUCH, MUCH MORE DIRECT AND POWERFUL! EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE NO "WORDS" SPOKEN, OR SIGNS MADE, THE INTENTION OF THE THOUGHTS WERE UNMISTAKABLE TO ME. I REALIZED LATER THAT, ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED THE THOUGHT, I DID NOT NECESSARILY INTERPRET IT'S MEANING EXACTLY.


I THINK THAT THE ALIEN BEING WAS NOT WILLING TO DISCUSS TECHNICAL MATTERS, DUE TO THE NATURE OF HER POSITION AS AN OFFICER AND PILOT WITH THE DUTY TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIRED BY HER OWN "UNIT" OR ORGANIZATION. ANY SOLDIER WHO IS CAPTURED BY THE "ENEMY" IN THE LINE OF DUTY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO WITHHOLD VITAL INFORMATION, EVEN IN THE FACE OF INTERROGATION OR TORTURE, OF COURSE.


BUT, IN SPITE OF THAT, I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE ALIEN BEING WAS NOT REALLY TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM ME. I JUST NEVER GOT THAT FEELING. HER COMMUNICATION ALWAYS SEEMED HONEST AND SINCERE TO ME. BUT, I SUPPOSE YOU CAN NEVER KNOW FOR SURE. I DEFINITELY FEEL THAT I SHARED A UNIQUE "BOND" WITH THE ALIEN. IT WAS A KIND OF "TRUST" OR EMPATHY THAT YOU HAVE WITH A PATIENT, OR A CHILD. I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THE ALIEN COULD UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN "HER" AND HAD NO HARMFUL INTENTION, NOR WOULD I ALLOW ANY HARM TO COME TO HER, IF I COULD PREVENT IT. THIS WAS TRUE TOO.
 

I REFER TO THE ALIEN AS "HER". ACTUALLY, THE BEING WAS NOT SEXUAL IN ANY WAY, EITHER PHYSIOLOGICALLY OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY. "SHE" DID HAVE A RATHER STRONG, FEMININE PRESENCE AND DEMEANOR. HOWEVER, IN TERMS OF PHYSIOLOGY, THE BEING WAS "ASEXUAL" AND HAD NO INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. HER BODY WAS MORE LIKE THE BODY OF A "DOLL" OR "ROBOT". THERE WERE NO INTERNAL "ORGANS", AS THE BODY WAS NOT CONSTRUCTED OF BIOLOGICAL CELLS. IT DID HAVE A KIND OF "CIRCUIT" SYSTEM OR ELECTRICAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT RAN THROUGHOUT THE BODY, BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKED.


IN STATURE AND APPEARANCE THE BODY WAS QUITE SHORT AND PETITE. ABOUT A 40 INCHES TALL. THE HEAD WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE, RELATIVE TO ARMS, LEGS AND TORSO, WHICH WHERE THIN. THERE WERE THREE "FINGERS" ON EACH OF TWO" HANDS" AND "FEET" WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT PREHENSILE. 22 (FOOTNOTE) THE HEAD HAD NO OPERATIONAL "NOSE" OR "MOUTH" OR "EARS". I UNDERSTOOD THAT A SPACE OFFICER DOES NOT NEED THESE AS SPACE HAS NO ATMOSPHERE TO CONDUCT SOUND. THEREFORE, SOUND RELATED SENSORY ORGANS ARE NOT BUILT INTO THE BODY. NOR DOES THE BODY NEED TO CONSUME FOOD, HENCE, THE ABSENCE OF A MOUTH.


THE EYES WERE QUITE LARGE. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT DEGREE OF VISUAL ACUITY OF WHICH THE EYES WERE CAPABLE, BUT I OBSERVED THAT HER SENSE OF SIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ACUTE. I THINK THE LENSES OF THE EYES, WHICH WERE VERY DARK AND OPAQUE, MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETECT WAVES OR PARTICLES BEYOND THE VISUAL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT. 23 (FOOTNOTE) I SUSPECT THAT THIS MAY HAVE INCLUDED THE FULL RANGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM, 24 (FOOTNOTE) OR MORE, BUT I DO NOT KNOW THIS FOR SURE.


WHEN THE BEING LOOKED AT ME HER GAZE SEEMED TO PENETRATE RIGHT THROUGH ME, AS THOUGH SHE HAD "X-RAY VISION". 25 (FOOTNOTE) I FOUND THIS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING, AT FIRST, UNTIL I REALIZED THAT SHE HAD NO SEXUAL INTENTIONS. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK SHE EVER EVEN HAD THE THOUGHT THAT I WAS MALE OR FEMALE.


IT BECOME VERY OBVIOUS AFTER A SHORT TIME WITH THE BEING THAT HER BODY DID NOT REQUIRE OXYGEN, FOOD OR WATER OR ANY OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCE OF NUTRITION OR ENERGY. AS I LEARNED LATER, THIS BEING SUPPLIED HER OWN "ENERGY", WHICH ANIMATED AND OPERATED THE BODY. IT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT EERIE AT FIRST, BUT I GOT USED TO THE IDEA. IT'S REALLY A VERY, VERY SIMPLE BODY. THERE IS NOT MUCH TO IT, COMPARED TO OUR OWN BODIES.


AIRL EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT MECHANICAL, LIKE A ROBOT, NOR WAS IT BIOLOGICAL. IT IS ANIMATED DIRECTLY BY HER AS A SPIRITUAL BEING. TECHNICALLY, FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT, I WOULD SAY THAT AIRL'S BODY COULD NOT EVEN BE CALLED "ALIVE". HER "DOLL" BODY IS NOT A BIOLOGICAL LIFE FORM, 26 (FOOTNOTE) WITH CELLS, AND SO FORTH.


IT HAD A SMOOTH SKIN, OR COVERING WHICH WAS GRAY IN COLOR. THE BODY WAS HIGHLY TOLERANT TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE, ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS, AND PRESSURE. THE LIMBS WERE QUITE FRAIL, WITHOUT MUSCULATURE. IN SPACE THERE IS NO GRAVITY, 27 (FOOTNOTE) SO VERY LITTLE MUSCLE STRENGTH IS NEEDED. THE BODY WAS USED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SPACE CRAFT OR IN LOW, OR NO-GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS. SINCE EARTH HAS A HEAVY GRAVITY, THE BODY WAS NOT ABLE TO WALK AROUND VERY WELL AS THE LEGS WERE NOT REALLY SUITED TO THAT PURPOSE. THE FEET AND HANDS WERE QUITE FLEXIBLE AND AGILE HOWEVER.


OVER NIGHT, BEFORE MY FIRST INTERVIEW WITH THE ALIEN, THE AREA HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO A BUZZING HIVE OF ACTIVITY. THERE WERE A DOZEN MEN WORKING ON SETTING UP LIGHTS AND CAMERA EQUIPMENT. A MOTION PICTURE CAMERA AND MICROPHONE AND A TAPE RECORDER WAS THERE ALSO SET UP IN THE "INTERVIEW ROOM". (I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY A MICROPHONE WAS NEEDED, SINCE THERE WAS NO VERBAL COMMUNICATION POSSIBLE WITH THE ALIEN.) THERE WAS ALSO A STENOGRAPHER 28 (FOOTNOTE) AND SEVERAL PEOPLE BUSILY TYPING ON TYPEWRITERS.


I WAS INFORMED THAT AN EXPERT FOREIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER AND A "CODE BREAKING" TEAM HAD BEEN FLOWN TO THE BASE DURING THE NIGHT TO ASSIST WITH MY EFFORTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN. THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL MEDICAL PERSONNEL -SPECIALISTS IN VARIOUS FIELDS - TO EXAMINE THE ALIEN. AND, A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY WAS THERE TO HELP FORMULATE QUESTIONS AND "INTERPRET" THE ANSWERS. AS I WAS JUST A NURSE, I WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A "QUALIFIED" INTERPRETER, EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THE ALIEN WAS THINKING!


THERE WERE MANY SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN US. EACH "INTERVIEW" RESULTED IN AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US, AS I WILL DISCUSS LATER ON IN MY NOTES. THIS IS THE FIRST TRANSCRIPT WITH THE ANSWERS TO A LIST OF QUESTIONS PROVIDED TO ME BY THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AT THE BASE WHICH I DEBRIEFED TO THE STENOGRAPHER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INTERVIEW."
 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)
TOP SECRET
OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD, 50 9TH BOMB GROUP

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 9. 7. 1947

 

"QUESTION - "ARE YOU INJURED?"
ANSWER -NO
QUESTION - "WHAT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DO YOU REQUIRE?"
ANSWER -NONE
QUESTION - "DO NEED FOOD OR WATER OR OTHER SUSTENANCE?"
ANSWER -NO
QUESTION - "DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS, SUCH AS AIR TEMPERATURE, ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL CONTENT, AIR PRESSURE, OR WASTE ELIMINATION?"
ANSWER -
NO. I AM NOT A BIOLOGICAL BEING.
QUESTION - "DOES YOUR BODY OR SPACE CRAFT CARRY ANY GERMS OR CONTAMINATION THAT MAY BE HARMFUL TO HUMANS OR OTHER EARTH LIFE FORMS?"
ANSWER -
NO GERMS IN SPACE.
QUESTION - "DOES YOUR GOVERNMENT KNOW YOU ARE HERE?"
ANSWER -
NOT AT THIS TIME
QUESTION - "ARE OTHERS OF YOUR KIND GOING TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU?"
ANSWER -
YES
QUESTION - "WHAT IS THE WEAPONS CAPABILITY OF YOUR PEOPLE?"
ANSWER -
VERY DESTRUCTIVE.


I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE EXACT NATURE OF THE KIND OF ARMS OR WEAPONS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE, BUT I DID NOT FEEL THAT THERE WAS ANY MALEVOLENT INTENTION IN HER REPLY, JUST A STATEMENT OF FACT.


QUESTION - "WHY DID YOUR SPACE CRAFT CRASH?" ANSWER -
IT WAS STRUCK BY AN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH CAUSED US TO LOSE CONTROL.
QUESTION - "WHY WAS YOUR SPACE CRAFT IN THIS AREA?"
ANSWER -
INVESTIGATION OF "BURNING CLOUDS" / RADIATION /
EXPLOSIONS 29 (FOOTNOTE)
QUESTION - "HOW DOES YOUR SPACE CRAFT FLY?" ANSWER -
IT IS CONTROLLED THROUGH "MIND". RESPONDS TO "THOUGHT COMMANDS".


"MIND" OR "THOUGHT COMMAND" ARE THE ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE WORDS I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE THE THOUGHT. THEIR BODIES, AND I THINK, THE SPACE CRAFT, ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THEM THROUGH SOME KIND OF ELECTRICAL "NERVOUS SYSTEM" THAT THEY CONTROL WITH THEIR OWN THOUGHTS.


QUESTION - "HOW DO YOUR PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER?"
ANSWER -
THROUGH MIND /THOUGHT.


THE WORDS "MIND" AND "THOUGHT" COMBINED TOGETHER ARE THE CLOSEST ENGLISH LANGUAGE WORDS I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE THE IDEA AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THEY COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY FROM THE MIND, JUST AS SHE IS COMMUNICATING WITH ME.


QUESTION - "DO YOU HAVE A WRITTEN LANGUAGE OR SYMBOLS FOR COMMUNICATION?"
ANSWER -YES
QUESTION - "WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?"

ANSWER -
THE HOME / BIRTHPLACE WORLD OF THE DOMAIN


SINCE I AM NOT AN ASTRONOMER, I HAVE NO WAY OF THINKING IN TERMS OF STARS, GALAXIES, CONSTELLATIONS AND DIRECTIONS IN SPACE. THE IMPRESSION I RECEIVED WAS OF A PLANET IN THE CENTER OF A HUGE CLUSTER OF GALAXIES THAT IS TO HER LIKE "HOME", OR "BIRTHPLACE". THE WORD "DOMAIN" IS THE CLOSEST WORD I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE HER CONCEPT, IMAGES AND THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE SHE IS FROM. IT COULD AS EASILY BE CALLED THE "TERRITORY" OR THE "REALM". HOWEVER, I AM SURE THAT IT WAS NOT JUST A PLANET OR A SOLAR SYSTEM OR A CLUSTER OF STARS, BUT AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF GALAXIES!


QUESTION - "WILL YOUR GOVERNMENT SEND REPRESENTATIVES TO MEET WITH OUR LEADERS?"
ANSWER -NO
QUESTION - "WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS CONCERNING
EARTH?" ANSWER -
PRESERVE / PROTECT PROPERTY OF THE DOMAIN QUESTION - "WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT EARTH GOVERNMENTS AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS?"
ANSWER -
POOR / SMALL. DESTROY PLANET.
QUESTION - "WHY HAVEN'T YOUR PEOPLE MADE YOUR EXISTENCE KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH?"
ANSWER -
WATCH / OBSERVE. NO CONTACT.


I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT CONTACT WITH PEOPLE ON EARTH WAS NOT PERMITTED, BUT I COULD NOT THINK OF A WORD OR IDEA THAT COMMUNICATED THE IMPRESSION I GOT EXACTLY. THEY ARE JUST OBSERVING US.


QUESTION - "HAVE YOUR PEOPLE VISITED EARTH'S PREVIOUSLY?"
ANSWER -
PERIODIC / REPEATING OBSERVATIONS.
QUESTION - "HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ABOUT EARTH?"
ANSWER -
LONG BEFORE HUMANS.


I AM NOT SURE IF THE WORD "PREHISTORIC" WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE HUMAN BEINGS EVOLVED.


QUESTION - "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION ON EARTH?"
ANSWER -
SMALL INTEREST / ATTENTION. SMALL TIME.


THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION SEEMED VERY VAGUE TO ME. HOWEVER, I PERCEIVED THAT HER INTEREST IN EARTH HISTORY IS NOT VERY STRONG OR THAT SHE DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT. OR, MAYBE, ... I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALLY GET AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION.


QUESTION - "CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOUR HOME WORLD TO US?"
ANSWER -
PLACE OF CIVILIZATION / CULTURE / HISTORY. LARGE PLANET. WEALTH / RESOURCES ALWAYS. ORDER. POWER.
KNOWLEDGE / WISDOM. TWO STARS. THREE MOONS.
QUESTION - "WHAT IS THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR CIVILIZATION?"
ANSWER -
ANCIENT. TRILLIONS OF YEARS. ALWAYS. ABOVE ALL OTHERS. PLAN. SCHEDULE. PROGRESS. WIN. HIGH GOALS / IDEAS.


I USE THE NUMBER "TRILLIONS" 30 (FOOTNOTE) BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT THE MEANING WAS A NUMBER LARGER THAN MANY BILLIONS. THE IDEA OF THE LENGTH OF TIME SHE COMMUNICATED IS BEYOND ME. IT'S REALLY CLOSER TO THE IDEA OF "INFINITY" IN TERMS OF EARTH YEARS.


QUESTION - "DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?"
ANSWER -
WE THINK. IT IS. MAKE IT CONTINUE. ALWAYS.


I AM SURE THAT THE ALIEN BEING DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF "GOD" OR "WORSHIP" AS WE DO. I ASSUME THAT THE PEOPLE IN HER CIVILIZATION WERE ALL ATHEISTS. MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THEMSELVES AND ARE VERY PRIDEFUL INDEED!


QUESTION - "WHAT TYPE OF SOCIETY DO YOU HAVE?"
ANSWER -
ORDER. POWER. FUTURE ALWAYS. CONTROL. GROW.


THESE ARE THE CLOSEST WORDS I COULD USE TO DESCRIBE THE IDEA SHE HAD ABOUT HER OWN SOCIETY OR CIVILIZATION. HER "EMOTION" WHEN COMMUNICATING HER RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION BECAME VERY INTENSE, VERY BRIGHT AND EMPHATIC! HER THOUGHT WAS FILLED WITH AN EMOTION THAT GAVE ME A FEELING OF JUBILATION OR JOY. BUT, IT MADE ME VERY NERVOUS ALSO.


QUESTION - "ARE THERE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS BESIDES YOURSELF IN THE UNIVERSE?"
ANSWER -
EVERYWHERE. WE ARE GREATEST / HIGHEST OF ALL.


DUE TO HER SMALL STATURE, I AM SURE THAT SHE DID NOT MEAN "TALLEST" OR "BIGGEST". AGAIN, HER PRIDEFUL "NATURE" SHOWED THROUGH IN THE FEELING I RECEIVED FROM HER."

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST INTERVIEW. WHEN THE ANSWERS TO THE FIRST LIST OF QUESTIONS WERE TYPED AND GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING FOR THEM, THEY WERE VERY EXCITED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET THE ALIEN TO SAY ANYTHING!


HOWEVER, AFTER THEY FINISHED READING MY ANSWERS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY. NOW THEY HAD A LOT OF NEW QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF THE ANSWERS I RECEIVED TO THE FIRST LIST OF QUESTIONS.


AN OFFICER TOLD ME TO AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. I WAITED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE ADJOINING OFFICE. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CONTINUE MY "INTERVIEW" WITH THE ALIEN. HOWEVER, I WAS ALWAYS WELL TREATED AND ALLOWED TO EAT AND SLEEP AND USE THE RESTROOM FACILITIES WHENEVER I WANTED.


EVENTUALLY, A NEW LIST OF QUESTIONS WAS WRITTEN FOR ME TO ASK THE ALIEN. I GATHERED THAT QUITE A FEW OTHER AGENTS, GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY OFFICIALS HAD ARRIVED AT THE BASE BY THIS TIME. THEY TOLD ME THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE IN THE ROOM WITH ME DURING THE NEXT INTERVIEW SO THEY COULD PROMPT ME TO ASK FOR MORE DETAILS DURING THE INTERVIEW. HOWEVER, WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW WITH THESE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, I RECEIVED NO THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS OR ANY OTHER PERCEPTIBLE COMMUNICATION FROM THE ALIEN. NOTHING. THE ALIEN JUST SAT IN A CHAIR WITHOUT MOVING.


WE ALL LEFT THE INTERVIEW ROOM. THE INTELLIGENCE AGENT BECAME VERY AGITATED ABOUT THIS. HE ACCUSED ME OF LYING OR MAKING UP THE ANSWERS TO THE FIRST QUESTIONS. I INSISTED THAT MY ANSWERS WERE HONEST, AND AS ACCURATE AS I COULD MAKE THEM!


LATER THAT DAY, IT WAS DECIDED THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WOULD ATTEMPT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE ALIEN. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF SEVERAL ATTEMPTS BY DIFFERENT "EXPERTS", NO ONE ELSE WAS EVER ABLE TO GET ANY COMMUNICATION AT ALL FROM THE ALIEN.


OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS A PSYCHIC RESEARCH SCIENTIST FROM BACK EAST WAS FLOWN TO THE BASE TO INTERVIEW THE ALIEN. HER NAME WAS GERTRUDE SOMETHING OR OTHER. I DON'T RECALL THE LAST NAME. 31 (FOOTNOTE) ON ANOTHER OCCASION AN INDIAN CLAIRVOYANT NAMED KRISHNAMURTI 32 (FOOTNOTE) CAME TO THE BASE TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN . NEITHER ONE WAS SUCCESSFUL AT GETTING THE ALIEN TO COMMUNICATE ANYTHING. I WAS PERSONALLY NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY WITH EITHER OF THESE PEOPLE EITHER, ALTHOUGH I DID THINK THAT MR. KRISHNAMURTI WAS A VERY KIND AND INTELLIGENT GENTLEMAN.


FINALLY, IT WAS DECIDED THAT I SHOULD BE LEFT WITH THE ALIEN BY MYSELF TO SEE IF I COULD GET ANY ANSWERS."

 

 

FOOTNOTES

22 "...PREHENSILE..."
THE WORD IS DERIVED FROM THE LATIN TERM PREHENDERE, MEANING "TO GRASP." IT IS THE QUALITY OF AN ORGAN THAT HAS ADAPTED FOR GRASPING OR HOLDING. EXAMPLES OF PREHENSILE BODY PARTS INCLUDE THE TAILS OF NEW WORLD MONKEYS AND OPOSSUMS, THE TRUNKS OF ELEPHANTS, THE TONGUES OF GIRAFFES, THE LIPS OF HORSES AND THE PROBOSCIDES OF TAPIR. THE HANDS OF PRIMATES ARE ALL PREHENSILE TO VARYING DEGREES, AND MANY SPECIES (EVEN A FEW HUMANS) HAVE PREHENSILE FEET AS WELL. THE CLAWS OF CATS ARE ALSO PREHENSILE. MANY EXTANT LIZARDS HAVE PREHENSILE TAILS (GECKOS, CHAMELEONS, AND A SPECIES OF SKINK). THE FOSSIL RECORD SHOWS PREHENSILE TAILS IN LIZARDS (SIMIOSAURIA) GOING BACK MANY MILLION YEARS TO THE TRIASSIC PERIOD.


PREHENSILITY IS AN EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION THAT HAS AFFORDED SPECIES A GREAT NATURAL ADVANTAGE IN MANIPULATING THEIR ENVIRONMENT FOR FEEDING, DIGGING, AND DEFENSE. IT ENABLES MANY ANIMALS, SUCH AS PRIMATES, TO USE TOOLS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE TASKS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HIGHLY SPECIALIZED ANATOMY. FOR EXAMPLE, CHIMPANZEES HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE STICKS TO FISH FOR TERMITES AND GRUBS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL PREHENSILE ORGANS ARE APPLIED TO TOOL USE- THE GIRAFFE TONGUE, FOR INSTANCE, IS INSTEAD USED IN FEEDING AND SELF-CLEANING BEHAVIORS."

23 "... ABLE TO DETECT WAVES OR PARTICLES BEYOND THE VISUAL SPECTRUM OF LIGHT."


THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM (OR SOMETIMES CALLED THE OPTICAL SPECTRUM) IS THE PORTION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM THAT IS VISIBLE TO (CAN BE DETECTED BY) THE HUMAN EYE. ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IN THIS RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS IS CALLED VISIBLE LIGHT OR SIMPLY LIGHT. A TYPICAL HUMAN EYE WILL RESPOND TO WAVELENGTHS IN AIR FROM ABOUT 380 TO 750 NM. THE CORRESPONDING WAVELENGTHS IN WATER AND OTHER MEDIA ARE REDUCED BY A FACTOR EQUAL TO THE REFRACTIVE INDEX. IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY, THIS CORRESPONDS TO A BAND IN THE VICINITY OF 400-790 TERAHERTZ. A LIGHT-ADAPTED EYE GENERALLY HAS ITS MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY AT AROUND 555 NM (540 THZ), IN THE GREEN REGION OF THE OPTICAL SPECTRUM. THE SPECTRUM DOES NOT, HOWEVER, CONTAIN ALL THE CORBRS THAT THE HUMAN EYES AND BRAIN CAN DISTINGUISH. BROWN, PINK, AND MAGENTA ARE ABSENT, FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THEY NEED A MIX OF MULTIPLE WAVELENGTHS, PREFERABLY SHADES OF RED.


WAVELENGTHS VISIBLE TO THE EYE ALSO PASS THROUGH THE "OPTICAL WINDOW", THE REGION OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM WHICH PASSES LARGELY UNATTENUATED THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE (ALTHOUGH BLUE LIGHT IS SCATTERED MORE THAN RED LIGHT, WHICH IS THE REASON THE SKY IS BLUE). THE RESPONSE OF THE HUMAN EYE IS DEFINED BY SUBJECTIVE TESTING, BUT THE ATMOSPHERIC WINDOWS ARE DEFINED BY PHYSICAL MEASUREMENT. THE "VISIBLE WINDOW" IS SO CALLED BECAUSE IT OVERLAPS THE HUMAN VISIBLE RESPONSE SPECTRUM; THE NEAR INFRARED WINDOWS LIE JUST OUT OF HUMAN RESPONSE WINDOW, AND THE MEDIUM WAVELENGTH AND LONG WAVELENGTH OR FAR INFRARED ARE FAR BEYOND THE HUMAN RESPONSE REGION.


THE EYES OF MANY SPECIES PERCEIVE WAVELENGTHS DIFFERENT FROM THE SPECTRUM VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY INSECTS, SUCH AS BEES, CAN SEE LIGHT IN THE ULTRAVIOLET, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR FINDING NECTAR IN FLOWERS. FOR THIS REASON, PLANT SPECIES WHOSE LIFE CYCLES ARE LINKED TO INSECT POLLINATION MAY OWE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS TO THEIR APPEARANCE IN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT, RATHER THAN HOW COLORFUL THEY APPEAR TO OUR EYES."

24"... THIS MAY HAVE INCLUDED THE FULL RANGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM..."
"THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM IS THE RANGE OF ALL POSSIBLE ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION. THE "ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM" (USUALLY JUST SPECTRUM) OF AN OBJECT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION FROM THAT OBJECT.


THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM EXTENDS FROM BELOW THE FREQUENCIES USED FOR MODEM RADIO (AT THE LONG-WAVELENGTH END) THROUGH GAMMA RADIATION (AT THE SHORT-WAVELENGTH END), COVERING WAVELENGTHS FROM THOUSANDS OF KILOMETRES DOWN TO A FRACTION THE SIZE OF AN ATOM. IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE SHORT WAVELENGTH LIMIT IS THE VICINITY OF THE PLANCK LENGTH, AND THE LONG WAVELENGTH LIMIT IS THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF, ALTHOUGH IN PRINCIPLE THE SPECTRUM IS INFINITE AND CONTINUOUS."

25"... HER GAZE SEEMED TO PENETRATE RIGHT THROUGH ME, AS THOUGH SHE HAD "X-RAY VISION".
"IN FICTIONAL STORIES, X-RAY VISION HAS GENERALLY BEEN PORTRAYED AS THE ABILITY TO SEE THROUGH LAYERS OF OBJECTS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE HOLDER OF THIS SUPERPOWER. PEOPLE OFTEN PRETEND TO HAVE THIS ABILITY THROUGH THE USE OF X-RAY GLASSES, WHICH ARE A SPECIAL TYPE OF "JOKE-AROUND" OR PRANK-GAG TOYS WITH THE SECRET OF ITS "X-RAY PROPERTIES" BEING UNKNOWN. THE GOAL IS USUALLY TO SEE THROUGH CLOTHING, USUALLY TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, BUT SOMETIMES FOR PURPOSE OF SEEING A PERSON'S PRIVATE PARTS. IN THE NON-FICTIONAL REALM, X-RAYS HAVE MANY PRACTICAL USES IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. WHILE THERE ARE DEVICES CURRENTLY EXTANT WHICH CAN "SEE" THROUGH CLOTHING (USING TERAHERTZ WAVES), MOST ARE QUITE BULKY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NIGHT VISION EQUIPPED VIDEO CAMERAS THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO SEE THROUGH CLOTHING AT A FREQUENCY JUST BELOW VISIBLE LIGHT."

"THE WORD "ORGANISM" MAY BROADLY BE DEFINED AS AN ASSEMBLY OF MOLECULES THAT FUNCTION AS A MORE OR LESS STABLE WHOLE AND HAS THE PROPERTIES OF LIFE. HOWEVER, MANY SOURCES, LEXICAL AND SCIENTIFIC, ADD CONDITIONS THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC TO DEFINING THE WORD.


THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY DEFINES AN ORGANISM AS "[AN] INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL, PLANT, OR SINGLE-CELLED LIFE FORM" THIS DEFINITION PROBLEMATICALLY EXCLUDES NON-ANIMAL AND PLANT MULTICELLULAR LIFE FORMS SUCH AS SOME FUNGI AND PROTISTA. LESS CONTROVERSIALLY, PERHAPS, IT EXCLUDES VIRUSES AND THEORETICALLY-POSSIBLE MAN-MADE NON-ORGANIC LIFE FORMS.


CHAMBERS ONLINE REFERENCE PROVIDES A MUCH BROADER DEFINITION: "ANY LIVING STRUCTURE, SUCH AS A PLANT, ANIMAL, FUNGUS OR BACTERIUM, CAPABLE OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION". THE DEFINITION "ANY LIFE FORM CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT REPRODUCTION, ORGANIC OR OTHERWISE" WOULD ENCOMPASS ALL CELLULAR LIFE, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF SYNTHETIC LIFE CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT REPRODUCTION, BUT WOULD EXCLUDE VIRUSES, WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON THE BIOCHEMICAL MACHINERY OF A HOST CELL FOR REPRODUCTION. SOME MAY USE A DEFINITION THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE VIRUSES."

27 "...IN SPACE THERE IS NOT GRAVITY..."
"THE TERMS GRAVITATION AND GRAVITY ARE MOSTLY INTERCHANGEABLE IN EVERYDAY USE, BUT IN SCIENTIFIC USAGE A DISTINCTION MAY HE MADE. "GRAVITATION" IS A GENERAL TERM DESCRIBING THE ATTRACTIVE INFLUENCE THAT ALL OBJECTS WITH MASS EXERT ON EACH OTHER, WHILE "GRAVITY" SPECIFICALLY REFERS TO A FORCE THAT IS SUPPOSED IN SOME THEORIES (SUCH AS NEWTON'S) TO BE THE CAUSE OF THIS ATTRACTION. BY CONTRAST, IN GENERAL RELATIVITY GRAVITATION IS DUE TO SPACE-TIME CURVATURES THAT CAUSE INERTIALLY MOVING OBJECTS TO ACCELERATE TOWARDS EACH OTHER.


ISAAC NEWTON'S THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION IS A PHYSICAL LAW DESCRIBING THE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN BODIES WITH MASS. IT IS A PART OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND WAS FIRST FORMULATED IN NEWTON'S WORK PHILOSOPHIAE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA. PUBLISHED IN 1687. IN MODEM LANGUAGE IT STATES THE FOLLOWING:


EVERY POINT MASS ATTRACTS EVERY OTHER POINT MASS BY A FORCE POINTING ALONG THE LINE INTERSECTING BOTH POINTS. THE FORCE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRODUCT OF THE TWO MASSES AND INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POINT MASSES:

WHERE:
• F - IS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINT MASSES,
• G - IS THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT
• M1 - IS THE MASS OF THE FIRST POINT MASS,
• M2 - IS THE MASS OF THE SECOND POINT MASS,
• R - IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO POINT MASSES."

28 "...STENOGRAPHER..."
"SHORTHAND IS AN ABBREVIATED AND/OR SYMBOLIC WRITING METHOD THAT INCREASES SPEED OR BREVITY OF WRITING AS COMPARED TO A NORMAL METHOD OF WRITING A LANGUAGE. THE PROCESS OF WRITING IN SHORTHAND IS CALLED STENOGRAPHY, FROM THE GREEK STENOS (NARROW) AND GRAPHE (WRITING). IT HAS ALSO BEEN CALLED BRACHYGRAPHY, FROM GREEK BRACHYS (SHORT) AND TACHYGRAPHY, FROM GREEK TACHYS (SWIFT, SPEEDY), DEPENDING ON WHETHER COMPRESSION OR SPEED OF WRITING IS THE GOAL. MANY FORMS OF SHORTHAND EXIST. A TYPICAL SHORTHAND SYSTEM PROVIDES SYMBOLS OR ABBREVIATIONS FOR WORDS AND COMMON PHRASES, WHICH ALLOW SOMEONE WELL TRAINED IN THE SYSTEM TO WRITE AS QUICKLY AS PEOPLE SPEAK. SHORTHAND WAS USED MORE WIDELY IN THE PAST, BEFORE THE INVENTION OF RECORDING AND DICTATION MACHINES."

29 "... INVESTIGATION OF "BURNING CLOUDS" / RADIATION / EXPLOSIONS..."
"JULY 16,1945..." - THE FIRST TEST OF A NUCLEAR DEVICE WAS MADE IN THE DESERT NORTH OF ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO. ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO IS ONLY 117 MILES FROM ALAMOGORDO.

NOTE: IN 1932 THAT BRITISH EXPLORERS IN MODEL-A FORDS FIRST VISITED THIS AREA OF WESTERN EGYPT, WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A MYSTERIOUS YELLOW-GREEN GLASS SCATTERED ACROSS THE SURFACE. EVER SINCE, LIBYAN DESERT GLASS HAS FASCINATED SCIENTISTS, WHO HAVE DREAMED UP ALL SORTS OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW IT COULD HAVE FORMED.

 

IT'S TOO SILICA RICH TO BE VOLCANIC. IN SOME WAYS IT RESEMBLES THE TEKTITES GENERATED BY THE HIGH PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH ASTEROID IMPACTS. VINCENZO DE MICHELE VISITED THE EGYPTIAN MUSEUM IN CAIRO, AND NOTICED THAT ONE OF KING TUTANKHAMUN'S JEWELED BREASTPLATES CONTAINED A CARVED SCARAB THAT LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE A PIECE OF THE GLASS.

 

A SIMPLE OPTICAL MEASUREMENT CONFIRMED THE MATCH IN 1998. NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS ARE HOT ENOUGH TO FUSE SURFACE MATERIALS INTO GLASS, MUCH LIKE THE FIRST ATOMIC EXPLOSION GENERATED YELLOW - GREEN GLASS AT THE TRINITY, NEW MEXICO SITE IN 1945. MANY SIMILAR SITES AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPLAINABLE "CATACLYSMIC" EVENTS REVEAL THE SAME YELLOW - GREEN GLASS. THIS "YELLOW-GREEN GLASS" HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN STRATA OF ROCK WHICH CONTAIN DINOSAUR FOSSILS ALL OVER THE WORLD.


JUNE 30, 1947 - "THE EVALUATION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB AS A MILITARY WEAPON", MADE BY THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION WAS RECEIVED BY PRESIDENT TRUMAN.

 

WITH A BRILLIANT FLOURISH OF SUICIDAL LOGIC, THAT ONLY THE MILITARY, POLITICIANS OTHER LUNATICS ARE CAPABLE OF FATHOMING, THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMISSION, BASED ON EXPLOSIONS OF BOMBS IN ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO, ON INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN TWO JAPANESE CITIES, AND ON THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, WAS AS FOLLOWS:

"PART III — CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
SECTION ONE - CONCLUSIONS

1. THE BOARD HAS REACHED THE FOLLOWING MAJOR CONCLUSIONS:

(1) IF USED IN NUMBERS, ATOMIC BOMBS NOT ONLY CAN NULLIFY ANY NATION'S MILITARY EFFORT, BUT CAN DEMOLISH ITS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURES AND PREVENT THEIR REESTABLISHMENT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. WITH SUCH WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY IF EMPLOYED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AS, FOR EXAMPLE, PATHOGENIC BACTERIA, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO DEPOPULATE VAST AREAS OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE, LEAVING ONLY VESTIGIAL REMNANTS OF MAN'S MATERIAL WORKS.
 

(2) THE THREAT OF THE UNCONTROLLED USE OF THE ATOMIC BOMB AND OF OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IS A THREAT TO MANKIND AND TO CIVILIZATION. ONLY THE OUTLAWING OF ALL WAR AND THE SETTING UP ON AN ADEQUATE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CAN LIFT THIS THREAT FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.
 

(3) IN THE ABSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GUARANTEES OF ABIDING PEACE, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CONTINUE THE MANUFACTURE AND STOCKPILING OF WEAPONS OF NUCLEAR FISSION AND TO CARRY ON CONTINUOUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN THE MEANS OF THEIR DELIVERY."

30 "...TRILLIONS..."
ONE THOUSAND THOUSAND = ONE MILLION. (1,000,000) ONE THOUSAND MILLION = ONE BILLION. (1,000,000,000) ONE THOUSAND BILLION = ONE TRILLION. (1,000,000,000,000 )


'THE ENGLISH NAMES FOR LARGE NUMBERS ARE COINED FROM THE LATIN NAMES FOR SMALL NUMBERS N BY ADDING THE ENDING -ILLION SUGGESTED BY THE NAME "MILLION." THUS BILLION AND TRILLION ARE COINED FROM THE LATIN PREFIXES HI- (N = 2) AND TRI- (N = 3), RESPECTIVELY.


IN RECENT YEARS, AMERICAN USAGE HAS ERODED THE EUROPEAN NUMBER DEFINITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMERICAN FINANCE, BECAUSE AMERICANS INSIST THAT $1,000,000,000 BE CALLED A BILLION DOLLARS. IN 1974, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRIME MINISTER HAROLD WILSON ANNOUNCED THAT HENCEFORTH "BILLION" WOULD MEAN 10G AND NOT 1012 IN OFFICIAL BRITISH REPORTS AND STATISTICS. ANYONE WHO USES THE WORDS "BILLION" AND 'TRILLION" INTERNATIONALLY SHOULD MAKE CLEAR WHICH MEANING OF THOSE WORDS IS INTENDED."

31 "...HER NAME WAS GERTRUDE SOMETHING OR OTHER..."
THIS WAS PROBABLY GERTRUDE R. SCHMEIDLER, WHO WAS A NOTABLE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND PARAPSYCHOLOGIST AT THE TIME. SHE PUBLISHED JOURNAL ARTICLES AND BOOKS ABOUT HOW VARIOUS FACTORS AND TRAITS AFFECT A PERSON'S EXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION (ESP) ABILITIES.
STUDIED THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN PARAPSYCHOLOGY, AND FORMED GROUPS AND INSTITUTES INTERESTED IN THE STUDY OF ESP, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH, THE DUKE UNIVERSITY PARAPSYCHOLOGY LABORATORY, AND THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION, INC.

REFLECTED IN MUCH OF HER RESEARCH IS THE WORK FOR WHICH SCHMEIDLER IS MOST NOTABLE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAPHOR OF THE SHEEP AND GOATS. SHE DETERMINED THROUGH SEVERAL CYCLES OF ESP CARD-GUESSING EXPERIMENTS THAT "SHEEP" (PERSONS WHO BELIEVED THAT SUCCESS WAS POSSIBLE IN ESP TASKS) SCORED HIGHER THAN "GOATS" (THOSE WHO REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS).
