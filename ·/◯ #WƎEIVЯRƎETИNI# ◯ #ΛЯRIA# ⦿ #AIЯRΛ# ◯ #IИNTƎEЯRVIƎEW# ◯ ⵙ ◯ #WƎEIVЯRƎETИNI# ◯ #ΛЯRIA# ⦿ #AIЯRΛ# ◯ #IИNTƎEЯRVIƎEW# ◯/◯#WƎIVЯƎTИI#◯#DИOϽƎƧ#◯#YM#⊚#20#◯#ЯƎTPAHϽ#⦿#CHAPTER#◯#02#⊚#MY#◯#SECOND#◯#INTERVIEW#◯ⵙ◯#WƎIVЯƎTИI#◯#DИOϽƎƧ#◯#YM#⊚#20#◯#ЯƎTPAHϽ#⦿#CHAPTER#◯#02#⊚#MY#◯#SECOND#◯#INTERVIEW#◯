CHAPTER TWO - MY SECOND INTERVIEW

"IN THE NEXT INTERVIEW I WAS TOLD TO ASK THE ALIEN ONLY ONE QUESTION."

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)
TOP SECRET
OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD, 509TH BOMB GROUP

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 10. 7. 1947


"QUESTION - "WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED COMMUNICATING?"
ANSWER -
NO STOP. OTHERS. HIDDEN / COVERED. SECRET FEAR.


THE ALIEN CAN NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF HER, OR DO NOT TRUST HER. AND, IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE ALIEN IS VERY AWARE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE SECRET INTENTIONS TOWARD HER AND ARE HIDING THEIR REAL THOUGHTS. IT IS EQUALLY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE ALIEN DOES NOT HAVE EVEN A TINY BIT OF FEAR OF US, OR ANYTHING ELSE, FOR THAT MATTER!"

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"I PONDERED THE WORDS I CHOSE TO CONVEY THE MEANING OF THE ALIENS THOUGHTS VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE REPORTING TO THE STENOGRAPHER AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING ANXIOUSLY IN THE OTHER ROOM.


PERSONALLY, I NEVER SUFFERED ANY FEAR OR MISAPPREHENSION ABOUT THE ALIEN WHATSOEVER. I WAS VERY, VERY CURIOUS AND EXCITED TO LEARN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT HER AND FROM HER. HOWEVER, LIKE THE ALIEN, I DID NOT HAVE MUCH TRUST OR CONFIDENCE IN THE AGENTS OR "AUTHORITIES" WHO WERE
CONTROLLING MY INTERVIEWS. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS TOWARD HER MIGHT BE. HOWEVER, I AM SURE THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS WERE VERY, VERY NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING AN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT AND PILOT ON THEIR HANDS!


AT THAT MOMENT, MY GREATEST WORRY WAS HOW TO MORE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS OF THE ALIEN. I THINK THAT I WAS DOING PRETTY WELL AS A TELEPATHIC "RECEIVER", BUT NOT AS GOOD AS TELEPATHIC "SENDER".


I WANTED DESPERATELY TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENABLE THE GROWING LEGION OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND HER MORE DIRECTLY, WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON MY INTERPRETATION OF HER THOUGHTS. I DID NOT FEEL VERY WELL QUALIFIED TO ACT AS AN INTERPRETER, YET I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WITH WHOM THE ALIEN WOULD COMMUNICATE, SO IT WAS UP TO ME TO GET THE JOB DONE.


I WAS ALSO BECOMING ACUTELY AWARE THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST "NEWS EVENT" IN THE HISTORY OF EARTH, AND THAT I SHOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE ANY PART IN IT. OF COURSE BY THAT TIME THE ENTIRE INCIDENT HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY DENIED IN THE PRESS AND A COVER-UP OF IMMENSE PROPORTIONS BY THE MILITARY AND THE "POWERS THAT BE" 33 (FOOTNOTE) HAD ALREADY BEGUN.


HOWEVER, I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING THE FIRST PERSON ON EARTH, AS FAR AS I KNEW, TO COMMUNICATE WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FORM! I THINK I KNOW HOW COLUMBUS 34 (FOOTNOTE) MUST HAVE FELT WHEN HE DISCOVERED A "NEW WORLD" THE SIZE OF A CONTINENT ON ONE SMALL PLANET. BUT, I WAS ABOUT TO DISCOVER AN ENTIRELY NEW, UNEXPLORED UNIVERSE! 35 (FOOTNOTE)


WHILE I WAITED FOR MY NEXT INSTRUCTIONS FROM MY SUPERIORS I WENT TO MY QUARTERS, UNDER ESCORT OF SEVERAL HEAVILY ARMED MPS. SEVERAL OTHER MEN DRESSED IN BLACK SUITS AND TIES ACCOMPANIED ME ALSO. THEY WERE STILL THERE WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING.

 

AFTER BREAKFAST, WHICH WAS BROUGHT TO ME IN MY OWN QUARTERS, THEY ESCORTED ME BACK TO THE OFFICE AT THE BASE THAT WAS USED FOR THE INTERVIEW."

 

FOOTNOTES

32...KRISHNAMURTI..."
"JIDDU KRISHNAMURTI (MAY 12, 1895 - FEBRUARY 17, 1986) WAS BORN INTO A TELUGU BRAHMIN FAMILY IN MADANAPALLE, INDIA, AND IN 1909 MET C.W. LEADBEATER ON THE PRIVATE BEACH AT THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS AT ADYAR IN MADRAS (NOW CHENNAI), INDIA. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RAISED UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF ANNIE BESANT AND C.W. LEADBEATER, LEADERS OF THE SOCIETY AT THE TIME, WHO BELIEVED HIM TO BE A "VEHICLE" FOR AN EXPECTED "WORLD TEACHER". AS A YOUNG MAN, HE DISAVOWED THIS IDEA AND DISSOLVED A WORLD-WIDE ORGANIZATION (THE ORDER OF THE STAR) ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT IT.

 

HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE TRAVELING THE WORLD AS AN INDIVIDUAL SPEAKER, SPEAKING TO LARGE AND SMALL GROUPS, AS WELL AS WITH INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS. HE WAS A WELL-KNOWN WRITER AND SPEAKER ON FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND SPIRITUAL SUBJECTS. HIS SUBJECT MATTER INCLUDED (BUT WAS NOT LIMITED TO): THE PURPOSE OF MEDITATION, HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS, AND HOW TO ENACT POSITIVE CHANGE IN GLOBAL SOCIETY.

 

AT THE AGE OF 34, HE PUBLICLY RENOUNCED THE FAME AND MESSIAH STATUS HE HAD GAINED FROM BEING PROCLAIMED THE NEW INCARNATION OF THE MAITREYA BUDDHA BY THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE PUBLISHING REGULARLY AND HOLDING PUBLIC TALKS, MOSTLY IN SOUTH ASIA, EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. AT AGE 90 HE ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF PEACE AND AWARENESS, AND WAS AWARDED THE 1984 UN PEACE MEDAL."

33 "...THE POWERS THAT BE... "
"MEANING -- THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF AUTHORITY.
ORIGIN - FROM THE BIBLE, ROMANS 13:1 (KING JAMES VERSION):

"LET EVERY SOUL BE SUBJECT UNTO THE HIGHER POWERS. FOR THERE IS NO POWER BUT OF GOD: THE POWERS THAT BE ARE ORDAINED OF GOD."
REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG
 

34 "...COLUMBUS... "
"THE NAME CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IS THE ANGLICIZATION OF THE LATIN CHRISTOPHORUS COLUMBUS. ALSO WELL KNOWN ARE HIS NAME'S RENDERING IN MODERN ITALIAN AS CRISTOFORO COLOMBO, IN PORTUGUESE AS CRISTÓVÃO COLOMBO (FORMERLY CHRISTOVAM COLOM), AND IN SPANISH AS CRISTOBAL COLON."
REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG


"PRE-COLUMBIAN TRANS-OCEANIC CONTACTS INVOLVE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE AMERICAS AND PEOPLES OF OTHER CONTINENTS - EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA, OR OCEANIA - BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN 1492. MANY SUCH EVENTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AT VARIOUS TIMES, BASED ON HISTORICAL REPORTS, ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDS, AND CULTURAL COMPARISONS."
(PLEASE REFER TO THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE ADDRESS FOR DETAILS OF MANY OTHER CONTACTS WITH THE "NEW WORLD" BEFORE COLUMBUS):
HTTP://EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG/WIKI/PRE-COLUMBIAN_TRANS-OCEANIC_CONTACT
 

35 "...UNEXPLORED UNIVERSE... "
THAT IS, "UNEXPLORED" BY HOMO SAPIENS. MUCH LIKE COLUMBUS, WHO "DISCOVERED" THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN EXPLORED BY EUROPEANS, IT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN EXPLORED BY THE MILLIONS OF INDIGENOUS INHABITANTS LONG BEFORE EUROPE EXISTED.


IF ANY OF THE INFORMATION IN THE "ALIEN INTERVIEW" TRANSCRIPTS IS FACTUAL, IT APPEARS THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS BEEN VERY, VERY THOROUGHLY EXPLORED INDEED -- BUT NOT BE HUMANS.

"I PONDERED THE WORDS I CHOSE TO CONVEY THE MEANING OF THE ALIENS THOUGHTS VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE REPORTING TO THE STENOGRAPHER AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING ANXIOUSLY IN THE OTHER ROOM.


PERSONALLY, I NEVER SUFFERED ANY FEAR OR MISAPPREHENSION ABOUT THE ALIEN WHATSOEVER. I WAS VERY, VERY CURIOUS AND EXCITED TO LEARN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT HER AND FROM HER. HOWEVER, LIKE THE ALIEN, I DID NOT HAVE MUCH TRUST OR CONFIDENCE IN THE AGENTS OR "AUTHORITIES" WHO WERE
CONTROLLING MY INTERVIEWS. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS TOWARD HER MIGHT BE. HOWEVER, I AM SURE THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS WERE VERY, VERY NERVOUS ABOUT HAVING AN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT AND PILOT ON THEIR HANDS!


AT THAT MOMENT, MY GREATEST WORRY WAS HOW TO MORE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS OF THE ALIEN. I THINK THAT I WAS DOING PRETTY WELL AS A TELEPATHIC "RECEIVER", BUT NOT AS GOOD AS TELEPATHIC "SENDER".


I WANTED DESPERATELY TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENABLE THE GROWING LEGION OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND HER MORE DIRECTLY, WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON MY INTERPRETATION OF HER THOUGHTS. I DID NOT FEEL VERY WELL QUALIFIED TO ACT AS AN INTERPRETER, YET I WAS THE ONLY PERSON WITH WHOM THE ALIEN WOULD COMMUNICATE, SO IT WAS UP TO ME TO GET THE JOB DONE.


I WAS ALSO BECOMING ACUTELY AWARE THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST "NEWS EVENT" IN THE HISTORY OF EARTH, AND THAT I SHOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE ANY PART IN IT. OF COURSE BY THAT TIME THE ENTIRE INCIDENT HAD BEEN OFFICIALLY DENIED IN THE PRESS AND A COVER-UP OF IMMENSE PROPORTIONS BY THE MILITARY AND THE "POWERS THAT BE" 33 (FOOTNOTE) HAD ALREADY BEGUN.


HOWEVER, I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEING THE FIRST PERSON ON EARTH, AS FAR AS I KNEW, TO COMMUNICATE WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE FORM! I THINK I KNOW HOW COLUMBUS 34 (FOOTNOTE) MUST HAVE FELT WHEN HE DISCOVERED A "NEW WORLD" THE SIZE OF A CONTINENT ON ONE SMALL PLANET. BUT, I WAS ABOUT TO DISCOVER AN ENTIRELY NEW, UNEXPLORED UNIVERSE! 35 (FOOTNOTE)


WHILE I WAITED FOR MY NEXT INSTRUCTIONS FROM MY SUPERIORS I WENT TO MY QUARTERS, UNDER ESCORT OF SEVERAL HEAVILY ARMED MPS. SEVERAL OTHER MEN DRESSED IN BLACK SUITS AND TIES ACCOMPANIED ME ALSO. THEY WERE STILL THERE WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING.

 

AFTER BREAKFAST, WHICH WAS BROUGHT TO ME IN MY OWN QUARTERS, THEY ESCORTED ME BACK TO THE OFFICE AT THE BASE THAT WAS USED FOR THE INTERVIEW."

32...KRISHNAMURTI..."
"JIDDU KRISHNAMURTI (MAY 12, 1895 - FEBRUARY 17, 1986) WAS BORN INTO A TELUGU BRAHMIN FAMILY IN MADANAPALLE, INDIA, AND IN 1909 MET C.W. LEADBEATER ON THE PRIVATE BEACH AT THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY HEADQUARTERS AT ADYAR IN MADRAS (NOW CHENNAI), INDIA. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RAISED UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF ANNIE BESANT AND C.W. LEADBEATER, LEADERS OF THE SOCIETY AT THE TIME, WHO BELIEVED HIM TO BE A "VEHICLE" FOR AN EXPECTED "WORLD TEACHER". AS A YOUNG MAN, HE DISAVOWED THIS IDEA AND DISSOLVED A WORLD-WIDE ORGANIZATION (THE ORDER OF THE STAR) ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT IT.

 

HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE TRAVELING THE WORLD AS AN INDIVIDUAL SPEAKER, SPEAKING TO LARGE AND SMALL GROUPS, AS WELL AS WITH INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS. HE WAS A WELL-KNOWN WRITER AND SPEAKER ON FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND SPIRITUAL SUBJECTS. HIS SUBJECT MATTER INCLUDED (BUT WAS NOT LIMITED TO): THE PURPOSE OF MEDITATION, HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS, AND HOW TO ENACT POSITIVE CHANGE IN GLOBAL SOCIETY.

 

AT THE AGE OF 34, HE PUBLICLY RENOUNCED THE FAME AND MESSIAH STATUS HE HAD GAINED FROM BEING PROCLAIMED THE NEW INCARNATION OF THE MAITREYA BUDDHA BY THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE PUBLISHING REGULARLY AND HOLDING PUBLIC TALKS, MOSTLY IN SOUTH ASIA, EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. AT AGE 90 HE ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF PEACE AND AWARENESS, AND WAS AWARDED THE 1984 UN PEACE MEDAL."

33 "...THE POWERS THAT BE... "
"MEANING -- THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF AUTHORITY.
ORIGIN - FROM THE BIBLE, ROMANS 13:1 (KING JAMES VERSION):

"LET EVERY SOUL BE SUBJECT UNTO THE HIGHER POWERS. FOR THERE IS NO POWER BUT OF GOD: THE POWERS THAT BE ARE ORDAINED OF GOD."

34 "...COLUMBUS... "
"THE NAME CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IS THE ANGLICIZATION OF THE LATIN CHRISTOPHORUS COLUMBUS. ALSO WELL KNOWN ARE HIS NAME'S RENDERING IN MODERN ITALIAN AS CRISTOFORO COLOMBO, IN PORTUGUESE AS CRISTÓVÃO COLOMBO (FORMERLY CHRISTOVAM COLOM), AND IN SPANISH AS CRISTOBAL COLON."

"PRE-COLUMBIAN TRANS-OCEANIC CONTACTS INVOLVE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE AMERICAS AND PEOPLES OF OTHER CONTINENTS - EUROPE, AFRICA, ASIA, OR OCEANIA - BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS IN 1492. MANY SUCH EVENTS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AT VARIOUS TIMES, BASED ON HISTORICAL REPORTS, ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDS, AND CULTURAL COMPARISONS."

35 "...UNEXPLORED UNIVERSE... "
THAT IS, "UNEXPLORED" BY HOMO SAPIENS. MUCH LIKE COLUMBUS, WHO "DISCOVERED" THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN EXPLORED BY EUROPEANS, IT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN EXPLORED BY THE MILLIONS OF INDIGENOUS INHABITANTS LONG BEFORE EUROPE EXISTED.


IF ANY OF THE INFORMATION IN THE "ALIEN INTERVIEW" TRANSCRIPTS IS FACTUAL, IT APPEARS THAT THE UNIVERSE HAS BEEN VERY, VERY THOROUGHLY EXPLORED INDEED -- BUT NOT BE HUMANS.
