CHAPTER FOURTEEN - AIRL REVIEWS THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"SHORTLY AFTER I FINISHED RECOUNTING THE PREVIOUS INTERVIEW WITH AIRL TO THE STENOGRAPHER, I WAS SUMMONED URGENTLY TO THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE BASE. I WAS ESCORTED BY FOUR HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY POLICEMEN. WHEN I ARRIVED, I WAS ASKED TO BE SEATED IN A VERY LARGE, MAKE-SHIFT OFFICE THAT HAD BEEN ARRANGED WITH A CONFERENCE TABLE AND CHAIRS. IN THE OFFICE WERE SEVERAL DIGNITARIES I HAD SEEN AT VARIOUS TIMES IN "THE GALLERY". I RECOGNIZED A FEW OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE FAMOUS MEN.


I WAS INTRODUCED TO THESE MEN, WHICH INCLUDED:


ARMY AIR FORCE SECRETARY SYMINGTON, 229 (FOOTNOTE) GENERAL NATHAN TWINING, 230 (FOOTNOTE) GENERAL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, 231 (FOOTNOTE) GENERAL VANDENBERG, 232 (FOOTNOTE) AND GENERAL NORSTAD. 233 (FOOTNOTE)


MUCH TO MY SURPRISE CHARLES LINDBERGH 234 (FOOTNOTE) WAS ALSO IN THE OFFICE. SECRETARY SYMINGTON EXPLAINED TO ME THAT MR. LINDBERG WAS THERE AS A CONSULTANT TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER MEN PRESENT IN THE ROOM WHO WERE NOT INTRODUCED. I ASSUME THESE MEN WERE PERSONAL AIDES TO THE OFFICERS OR AGENTS OF SOME INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.


ALL OF THIS SUDDEN ATTENTION, NOT ONLY FROM THE SECRETARY AND GENERALS, BUT FROM SUCH WORLD FAMOUS PEOPLE AS MR. LINDBERGH, AND GENERAL DOOLITTLE, MADE ME REALIZE HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MY ROLE AS AN "INTERPRETER" FOR AIRL WAS, AS SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF OTHERS. UNTIL THIS TIME I WAS NOT REALLY AWARE OF THIS EXCEPT IN AN PERIPHERAL SENSE. I SUPPOSE THIS WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO ABSORBED IN DETAILS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION. SUDDENLY, I BEGAN TO GRASP THE MAGNITUDE OF MY ROLE. I THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE MEN IN THAT MEETING WAS INTENDED, IN PART, TO IMPRESS ME WITH THIS FACT!
 

THE SECRETARY INSTRUCTED ME NOT TO BE NERVOUS. HE SAID THAT I WAS NOT IN ANY TROUBLE. HE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT THE ALIEN WOULD BE WILLING TO ANSWER A LIST OF QUESTIONS THEY HAD PREPARED. HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE VERY EAGER TO DISCOVER MANY MORE DETAILS ABOUT AIRL, THE FLYING DISC, THE DOMAIN, AND MANY OTHER SUBJECTS THAT AIRL HAD DISCLOSED IN THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS. OF COURSE, THEY WERE MAINLY INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MILITARY SECURITY AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FLYING DISC.


I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS VERY SURE THAT AIRL HAD NOT CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT ANSWERING QUESTIONS, AS NOTHING HAD CHANGED THAT WOULD CAUSE HER TO TRUST THE INTENTIONS OF THE MEN IN THE GALLERY. I REPEATED THAT AIRL HAD COMMUNICATED EVERYTHING THAT SHE WAS WILLING AND AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS ALREADY.


IN SPITE OF THIS, THEY INSISTED THAT I WOULD ASK AIRL AGAIN IF SHE WOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND, IF THE ANSWER WAS STILL "NO", I WAS TO ASK HER IF SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO READ THE WRITTEN COPIES OF THE TRANSCRIPTS OF MY INTERVIEW "TRANSLATIONS". THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF AIRL WOULD VERIFY THAT MY UNDERSTANDING AND TRANSLATION OF OUR INTERVIEWS WAS CORRECT.


SINCE AIRL COULD READ ENGLISH VERY FLUENTLY, THE SECRETARY ASKED IF THEY COULD BE ALLOWED TO OBSERVE FOR THEMSELVES WHILE AIRL READ THE TRANSCRIPTS, AND VERIFY THAT THEY WERE CORRECT IN WRITING. THEY WANTED HER TO WRITE ON A COPY OF THE TRANSCRIPT WHETHER THE "TRANSLATIONS" WERE CORRECT, OR NOT, AND MAKE A NOTE OF ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT ACCURATE ON THE TRANSCRIPTS.

 

OF COURSE, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO OBEY ORDERS AND I DID EXACTLY WHAT THE SECRETARY REQUESTED.


I WAS GIVEN A COPY OF THE TRANSCRIPTS, WITH A SIGNATURE PAGE, WHICH I WAS TO SHOW TO AIRL. AFTER AIRL COMPLETED HER REVIEW, I WAS ALSO DIRECTED TO REQUEST THAT AIRL SIGN THE COVER-PAGE, ATTESTING THAT ALL OF THE TRANSLATIONS IN THE TRANSCRIPTS WERE CORRECT, AS AMENDED BY HER.


ABOUT AN HOUR LATER I ENTERED THE INTERVIEW ROOM, AS INSTRUCTED, WITH COPIES OF THE TRANSCRIPTS AND SIGNATURE PAGE TO DELIVER TO AIRL AS THE MEMBERS OF THE GALLERY, INCLUDING THE GENERALS, (AND MR. LINDBERG ALSO, I PRESUME) AND OTHERS WATCHED THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE GALLERY ROOM.


I WENT TO MY USUAL SEAT, SITTING 4 OR 5 FEET ACROSS FROM AIRL. I PRESENTED THE ENVELOPE OF TRANSCRIPTS TO AIRL, AND PASSED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE SECRETARY, TELEPATHICALLY. AIRL LOOKED AT ME, AND LOOKED AT THE ENVELOPE, WITHOUT ACCEPTING IT.


AIRL SAID:

"IF YOU HAVE READ THEM AND THEY ARE ACCURATE IN YOU OWN ESTIMATION, THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO REVIEW THEM ALSO. THE TRANSLATIONS ARE CORRECT. YOU CAN TELL YOUR COMMANDER THAT YOU HAVE FAITHFULLY CONVEYED A RECORD OF OUR COMMUNICATION."

I ASSURED AIRL THAT I HAD READ THEM, AND THEY WERE EXACT RECORDINGS OF EVERYTHING I TOLD THE TRANSCRIPTION TYPIST.

"WILL YOU SIGN THE COVER PAGE THEN?", I ASKED.
"NO, I WILL NOT.", SAID AIRL.
"MAY I ASK WHY NOT?", I SAID.

I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHY SHE WASN'T WILLING TO DO SUCH A SIMPLE THING.

"IF YOUR COMMANDER DOES NOT TRUST HIS OWN STAFF TO MAKE AN HONEST AND ACCURATE REPORT TO HIM, WHAT CONFIDENCE WILL MY SIGNATURE ON THE PAGE GIVE HIM? WHY WILL HE TRUST AN INK MARK ON A PAGE MADE BY AN OFFICER OF THE DOMAIN, IF HE DOES NOT TRUST HIS OWN, LOYAL STAFF?"

I DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.

 

I COULDN'T ARGUE WITH AIRL'S LOGIC, AND I COULDN'T FORCE HER TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT EITHER. I SAT IN MY CHAIR FOR A MINUTE WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT. I THANKED AIRL AND TOLD HER I NEEDED TO GO ASK MY SUPERIORS FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. I PLACED THE ENVELOPE OF THE TRANSCRIPTS IN THE INSIDE BREAST POCKET OF MY UNIFORM JACKET AND BEGAN TO RISE FROM MY CHAIR.


AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR FROM THE GALLERY ROOM SLAMMED OPEN! FIVE HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY POLICE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM! A MAN IN A WHITE LABORATORY COAT FOLLOWED CLOSELY BEHIND THEM. HE PUSHED A SMALL CART THAT CARRIED A BOX-SHAPED MACHINE WITH A LOT OF DIALS ON THE FACE OF IT.


BEFORE I COULD REACT, TWO OF THE MPS GRABBED AIRL AND HELD HER FIRMLY DOWN IN THE OVERSTUFFED CHAIR SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ON SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR INTERVIEWS TOGETHER. THE TWO OTHER MPS GRABBED MY SHOULDERS AND PUSHED ME BACK DOWN ON MY CHAIR AND HELD ME THERE. THE OTHER MP STOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF AIRL, POINTING A RIFLE DIRECTLY AT HER, NOT MORE THAN SIX INCHES FROM HER HEAD.


THE MAN IN THE LAB COAT QUICKLY WHEELED THE CART BEHIND AIRL'S CHAIR. HE DEFTLY PLACED A CIRCULAR HEAD BAND OVER AIRL'S HEAD AND TURNED BACK TO THE MACHINE ON THE CART.

 

SUDDENLY, HE SHOUTED THE WORD "CLEAR!"


THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE HOLDING AIRL RELEASED HER. AT THAT INSTANT I SAW AIRL'S BODY STIFFEN AND SHUDDER. THIS LASTED FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20 SECONDS. THE MACHINE OPERATOR TURNED A KNOB ON THE MACHINE AND AIRL'S BODY SLUMPED BACK INTO THE CHAIR. AFTER A FEW SECONDS HE TURNED THE KNOB AGAIN AND AIRL'S BODY STIFFENED AS BEFORE. HE REPEATED THE SAME PROCESS SEVERAL MORE TIMES.


I SAT IN MY CHAIR, BEING HELD DOWN ALL THE WHILE BY THE MPS. AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS TERRIFIED AND TRANSFIXED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING! I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!


AFTER A FEW MINUTES SEVERAL OTHER MEN WEARING WHITE LAB COATS ENTERED THE ROOM. THEY BRIEFLY EXAMINED AIRL WHO WAS NOW SLUMPED LISTLESSLY IN THE CHAIR. THEY MUMBLED A FEW WORDS TO EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE MEN WAVED TO THE GALLERY WINDOW. A GURNEY WAS IMMEDIATELY ROLLED INTO THE ROOM BY TWO ATTENDANTS. THESE MEN LIFTED AIRL'S LIMP BODY ONTO THE GURNEY, STRAPPED HER DOWN ACROSS HER CHEST AND ARMS, AND ROLLED IT OUT OF THE ROOM.
 

I WAS IMMEDIATELY ESCORTED OUT OF THE INTERVIEW ROOM BY THE MPS AND TAKEN DIRECTLY TO MY QUARTERS, WHERE I WAS LOCKED IN MY ROOM WITH THE MPS REMAINING AT GUARD OUTSIDE THE DOOR.


AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR TO MY QUARTERS. WHEN I OPENED IT GENERAL TWINING ENTERED, TOGETHER WITH THE MACHINE OPERATOR IN THE WHITE LAB COAT. THE GENERAL INTRODUCED THE MAN TO ME AS DR. WILCOX. 235 (FOOTNOTE). HE ASKED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND THE DOCTOR.

 

WE LEFT THE ROOM, FOLLOWED BY THE MPS. AFTER SEVERAL TWISTS AND TURNS THROUGH THE COMPLEX WE ENTERED A SMALL ROOM WHERE AIRL HAD BEEN WHEELED ON THE GURNEY.


THE GENERAL TOLD ME THAT AIRL AND THE DOMAIN WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A VERY GREAT MILITARY THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES. AIRL HAD BEEN "IMMOBILIZED" SO THAT SHE COULD NOT DEPART AND RETURN TO HER BASE, AS SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO IN THE INTERVIEW. IT WOULD BE A VERY GRAVE RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITY TO ALLOW AIRL TO REPORT WHAT SHE OBSERVED DURING HER TIME AT THE BASE. SO, IT HAD BEEN DETERMINED THAT DECISIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED TO PREVENT THIS.
 

THE GENERAL ASKED ME IF I UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS WAS NECESSARY.

 

I SAID THAT I DID, ALTHOUGH I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT AGREE THAT IT WAS THE LEAST BIT NECESSARY AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT AGREE WITH THE "SURPRISE ATTACK" ON AIRL AND ME IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM! HOWEVER, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS TO THE GENERAL BECAUSE I WAS VERY AFRAID OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME AND AIRL IF I PROTESTED.


DR. WILCOX ASKED ME TO APPROACH THE GURNEY AND STAND NEXT TO AIRL. AIRL LAY PERFECTLY STILL AND UNMOVING ON THE BED. I COULD NOT TELL WHETHER SHE WAS ALIVE OR DEAD. SEVERAL OTHER MEN IN WHITE LAB COATS, WHO I ASSUMED WERE ALSO DOCTORS, STOOD ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BED. THEY HAD CONNECTED TWO PIECES OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT TO AIRL'S HEAD, ARMS AND CHEST.

 

ONE OF THESE DEVICES I RECOGNIZED FROM MY TRAINING AS A SURGICAL NURSE AS AN EEG MACHINE 236 (FOOTNOTE) WHICH IS USED TO DETECT ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN. THE OTHER DEVICE WAS A NORMAL HOSPITAL ROOM VITAL SIGNS MONITOR, WHICH I KNEW WOULD BE USELESS SINCE AIRL DID NOT HAVE A BIOLOGICAL BODY.


DR. WILCOX EXPLAINED TO ME THAT HE HAD ADMINISTERED A SERIES OF "MILD" ELECTROSHOCKS TO AIRL IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE HER LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES TIME TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION AND DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH AIRL.


HE ASKED ME TO ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH AIRL, TELEPATHICALLY.


I TRIED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BUT COULDN'T SENSE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM AIRL. I COULDN'T EVEN SENSE WHETHER AIRL WAS PRESENT IN THE BODY ANY LONGER!

"I THINK YOU MUST HAVE KILLED HER", I SAID TO THE DOCTOR.

DR. WILCOX TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD KEEP AIRL UNDER OBSERVATION AND THAT I WOULD BE ASKED TO RETURN LATER TO TRY TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH AIRL AGAIN."

231 "... GENERAL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, ... "
"SOON AFTER THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR AND THE US ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR II, DOOLITTLE WAS PROMOTED TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL ON JANUARY 2, 1942, AND WENT TO HEADQUARTERS ARMY AIR FORCE TO PLAN THE FIRST AERIAL RAID ON THE JAPANESE HOMELAND. HE VOLUNTEERED AND RECEIVED GEN. H.H. ARNOLD'S APPROVAL TO LEAD THE ATTACK OF 16 B-25 MEDIUM BOMBERS FROM THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS HORNET, WITH TARGETS IN TOKYO, KOBE, OSAKA, AND NAGOYA. IT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY COMBAT MISSION OF HIS MILITARY CAREER.


DOOLITTLE RECEIVED THE MEDAL OF HONOR, PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR PLANNING AND LEADING THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. THE DOOLITTLE RAID IS VIEWED BY HISTORIANS AS A MAJOR PUBLIC-RELATIONS VICTORY FOR THE UNITED STATES. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE TO JAPANESE WAR INDUSTRY WAS MINOR, THE RAID SHOWED THE JAPANESE THEIR HOMELAND WAS NOT INVULNERABLE.


DOOLITTLE WAS PORTRAYED BY SPENCER TRACY IN THE 1944 FILM THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO AND BY ALEC BALDWIN IN THE 2001 FILM PEARL HARBOR, IN WHICH THE DOOLITTLE RAID WAS DEPICTED.


ON MAY 10, 1946, DOOLITTLE REVERTED TO INACTIVE RESERVE STATUS AND RETURNED TO SHELL OIL AS A VICE PRESIDENT, AND LATER AS A DIRECTOR. HE WAS THE HIGHEST-RANKING RESERVE OFFICER TO SERVE IN THE U.S. MILITARY IN WORLD WAR II."

233 "... GENERAL NORSTAD..."
"ON OCTOBER 1, 1947, FOLLOWING THE DIVISION OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT INTO THE DEPARTMENTS OF THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE, GENERAL NORSTAD WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR OPERATIONS OF THE AIR FORCE."

234 "... CHARLES LINDBERGH WAS ALSO IN THE OFFICE..."
"CHARLES LINDBERGH GAINED SUDDEN GREAT INTERNATIONAL FAME AS THE FIRST PILOT TO FLY SOLO ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. HE FLEW FROM ROOSEVELT AIRFIELD IN GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK, TO PARIS (LE BOURGET AIRPORT) ON 20 MAY - 21 MAY 1927 IN 33.5 HOURS. HIS PLANE WAS THE SINGLE-ENGINE AIRCRAFT, THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS.


LINDBERGH'S ACCOMPLISHMENT WON HIM THE ORTEIG PRIZE; MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE PRIZE MONEY WAS THE ACCLAIM THAT RESULTED FROM HIS DARING FLIGHT. A TICKER-TAPE PARADE WAS HELD FOR HIM DOWN 5TH AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY ON 13 JUNE 1927.


HIS PUBLIC STATURE FOLLOWING THIS FLIGHT WAS SUCH THAT HE BECAME AN IMPORTANT VOICE ON BEHALF OF AVIATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE MASSIVE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING HIM AND HIS FLIGHT BOOSTED THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY AND MADE A SKEPTICAL PUBLIC TAKE AIR TRAVEL SERIOUSLY. LINDBERGH IS RECOGNIZED IN AVIATION FOR DEMONSTRATING AND CHARTING POLAR AIR-ROUTES, HIGH ALTITUDE FLYING TECHNIQUES, AND INCREASING AIRCRAFT FLYING RANGE BY DECREASING FUEL CONSUMPTION. THESE INNOVATIONS ARE THE BASIS OF MODERN INTERCONTINENTAL AIR TRAVEL.


IN HIS SIX MONTHS DURING WW II IN THE PACIFIC IN 1944, LINDBERGH TOOK PART IN FIGHTER BOMBER RAIDS ON JAPANESE POSITIONS, FLYING ABOUT 50 COMBAT MISSIONS (AS A CIVILIAN). THE U.S. MARINE AND ARMY AIR FORCE PILOTS WHO SERVED WITH LINDBERGH ADMIRED AND RESPECTED HIM, PRAISING HIS COURAGE AND DEFENDING HIS PATRIOTISM.


AFTER WORLD WAR II HE LIVED QUIETLY IN CONNECTICUT AS A CONSULTANT BOTH TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND TO PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS. HIS 1953 BOOK THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS, RECOUNTING HIS NON-STOP TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT, WON THE PULITZER PRIZE IN 1954.


DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER RESTORED LINDBERGH S ASSIGNMENT WITH THE ARMY AIR CORPS AND MADE HIM A BRIGADIER GENERAL IN 1954. IN THAT YEAR, HE SERVED ON THE CONGRESSIONAL ADVISORY PANEL SET UP TO ESTABLISH THE SITE OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY. IN DECEMBER 1968, HE VISITED THE CREW OF APOLLO 8 ON THE EVE OF THE FIRST MANNED SPACEFLIGHT TO LEAVE EARTH ORBIT.


FROM THE 1960S ON, LINDBERGH BECAME AN ADVOCATE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE NATURAL WORLD, CAMPAIGNING TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE HUMPBACK AND BLUE WHALES, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING PROTECTIONS FOR THE "PRIMITIVE" FILIPINO GROUP THE TASADAY AND AFRICAN TRIBES, AND SUPPORTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL PARK. WHILE STUDYING THE NATIVE FLORA AND FAUNA OF THE PHILIPPINES, HE ALSO BECAME INVOLVED IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE PHILIPPINE EAGLE.


IN HIS FINAL YEARS, LINDBERGH BECAME TROUBLED THAT THE WORLD WAS OUT OF BALANCE WITH ITS NATURAL ENVIRONMENT; HE STRESSED THE NEED TO REGAIN THAT BALANCE, AND SPOKE AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF SUPERSONIC AIRLINERS.


LINDBERGH S SPEECHES AND WRITINGS LATER IN LIFE EMPHASIZED HIS LOVE OF BOTH TECHNOLOGY AND NATURE, AND A LIFELONG BELIEF THAT "ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MANKIND HAVE VALUE ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY PRESERVE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE."


IN A 1967 LIFE MAGAZINE ARTICLE, HE SAID, "THE HUMAN FUTURE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO COMBINE THE KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE WITH THE WISDOM OF WILDNESS."

PAUL H. WILCOX, M. D. THE TRAVERSE CITY STATE HOSPITAL, TRAVERSE CITY, MICHIGAN.


IS THE AUTHOR OF THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE, PUBLISHED IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY IN AUGUST OF 1947:

"A REVIEW OF OVER 23,000 TREATMENTS USING UNIDIRECTIONAL CURRENTS
1. FORTY PERCENT OF THE MOST CHRONIC PATIENTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN WARD BEHAVIOR IF ADEQUATELY AND REPEATEDLY TREATED WITH SUITABLE TYPE OF ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY. RELAPSES MUST BE TREATED WHENEVER THEY OCCUR OVER MONTHS AND YEARS.
2. AT LEAST 60% OF EARLY CASES, AGED 60 OR UNDER, WERE REHABILITATED WITHIN 1 YEAR WHEN ADEQUATELY TREATED AND 65% BY THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THE START OF TREATMENT.
3. ADEQUATE TREATMENT MEANS INTENSIVE TREATMENT UNTIL THE EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED AND INTENSIVE TREATMENT OF RELAPSES WHEN THEY OCCUR. NO PATIENT, OTHERWISE SUITABLE WHO STILL IS NOT REHABILITATED AFTER 1 YEAR, HAS HAD AN ADEQUATE TRIAL OF TREATMENT WITH LESS THAN 20 TREATMENTS.
4. AN IDEAL THERAPY IS ONE WHICH ACHIEVES BENEFICIAL RESULTS WITHOUT CAUSING ACCUMULATING BRAIN DAMAGE, THUS PERMITTING ITS USE REPEATEDLY FOR YEARS IF NECESSARY.
5. THIS IDEAL IS APPROACHED BY THE RELATIVELY LOW INTENSITY 60-CYCLE PULSATING DIRECT CURRENT USED IN THE TREATMENT OF THE PATIENTS REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER. THIS TECHNIQUE ALSO HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN EXCEPTIONALLY LOW PERCENTAGE OF SKELETAL COMPLICATIONS."

CHAPTER FOURTEEN - AIRL REVIEWS THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"SHORTLY AFTER I FINISHED RECOUNTING THE PREVIOUS INTERVIEW WITH AIRL TO THE STENOGRAPHER, I WAS SUMMONED URGENTLY TO THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE BASE. I WAS ESCORTED BY FOUR HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY POLICEMEN. WHEN I ARRIVED, I WAS ASKED TO BE SEATED IN A VERY LARGE, MAKE-SHIFT OFFICE THAT HAD BEEN ARRANGED WITH A CONFERENCE TABLE AND CHAIRS. IN THE OFFICE WERE SEVERAL DIGNITARIES I HAD SEEN AT VARIOUS TIMES IN "THE GALLERY". I RECOGNIZED A FEW OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE FAMOUS MEN.


I WAS INTRODUCED TO THESE MEN, WHICH INCLUDED:


ARMY AIR FORCE SECRETARY SYMINGTON, 229 (FOOTNOTE) GENERAL NATHAN TWINING, 230 (FOOTNOTE) GENERAL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, 231 (FOOTNOTE) GENERAL VANDENBERG, 232 (FOOTNOTE) AND GENERAL NORSTAD. 233 (FOOTNOTE)


MUCH TO MY SURPRISE CHARLES LINDBERGH 234 (FOOTNOTE) WAS ALSO IN THE OFFICE. SECRETARY SYMINGTON EXPLAINED TO ME THAT MR. LINDBERG WAS THERE AS A CONSULTANT TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER MEN PRESENT IN THE ROOM WHO WERE NOT INTRODUCED. I ASSUME THESE MEN WERE PERSONAL AIDES TO THE OFFICERS OR AGENTS OF SOME INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.


ALL OF THIS SUDDEN ATTENTION, NOT ONLY FROM THE SECRETARY AND GENERALS, BUT FROM SUCH WORLD FAMOUS PEOPLE AS MR. LINDBERGH, AND GENERAL DOOLITTLE, MADE ME REALIZE HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MY ROLE AS AN "INTERPRETER" FOR AIRL WAS, AS SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF OTHERS. UNTIL THIS TIME I WAS NOT REALLY AWARE OF THIS EXCEPT IN AN PERIPHERAL SENSE. I SUPPOSE THIS WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO ABSORBED IN DETAILS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION. SUDDENLY, I BEGAN TO GRASP THE MAGNITUDE OF MY ROLE. I THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE MEN IN THAT MEETING WAS INTENDED, IN PART, TO IMPRESS ME WITH THIS FACT!
 

THE SECRETARY INSTRUCTED ME NOT TO BE NERVOUS. HE SAID THAT I WAS NOT IN ANY TROUBLE. HE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT THE ALIEN WOULD BE WILLING TO ANSWER A LIST OF QUESTIONS THEY HAD PREPARED. HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE VERY EAGER TO DISCOVER MANY MORE DETAILS ABOUT AIRL, THE FLYING DISC, THE DOMAIN, AND MANY OTHER SUBJECTS THAT AIRL HAD DISCLOSED IN THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS. OF COURSE, THEY WERE MAINLY INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MILITARY SECURITY AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FLYING DISC.


I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS VERY SURE THAT AIRL HAD NOT CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT ANSWERING QUESTIONS, AS NOTHING HAD CHANGED THAT WOULD CAUSE HER TO TRUST THE INTENTIONS OF THE MEN IN THE GALLERY. I REPEATED THAT AIRL HAD COMMUNICATED EVERYTHING THAT SHE WAS WILLING AND AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS ALREADY.


IN SPITE OF THIS, THEY INSISTED THAT I WOULD ASK AIRL AGAIN IF SHE WOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND, IF THE ANSWER WAS STILL "NO", I WAS TO ASK HER IF SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO READ THE WRITTEN COPIES OF THE TRANSCRIPTS OF MY INTERVIEW "TRANSLATIONS". THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF AIRL WOULD VERIFY THAT MY UNDERSTANDING AND TRANSLATION OF OUR INTERVIEWS WAS CORRECT.


SINCE AIRL COULD READ ENGLISH VERY FLUENTLY, THE SECRETARY ASKED IF THEY COULD BE ALLOWED TO OBSERVE FOR THEMSELVES WHILE AIRL READ THE TRANSCRIPTS, AND VERIFY THAT THEY WERE CORRECT IN WRITING. THEY WANTED HER TO WRITE ON A COPY OF THE TRANSCRIPT WHETHER THE "TRANSLATIONS" WERE CORRECT, OR NOT, AND MAKE A NOTE OF ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT ACCURATE ON THE TRANSCRIPTS.

 

OF COURSE, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO OBEY ORDERS AND I DID EXACTLY WHAT THE SECRETARY REQUESTED.


I WAS GIVEN A COPY OF THE TRANSCRIPTS, WITH A SIGNATURE PAGE, WHICH I WAS TO SHOW TO AIRL. AFTER AIRL COMPLETED HER REVIEW, I WAS ALSO DIRECTED TO REQUEST THAT AIRL SIGN THE COVER-PAGE, ATTESTING THAT ALL OF THE TRANSLATIONS IN THE TRANSCRIPTS WERE CORRECT, AS AMENDED BY HER.


ABOUT AN HOUR LATER I ENTERED THE INTERVIEW ROOM, AS INSTRUCTED, WITH COPIES OF THE TRANSCRIPTS AND SIGNATURE PAGE TO DELIVER TO AIRL AS THE MEMBERS OF THE GALLERY, INCLUDING THE GENERALS, (AND MR. LINDBERG ALSO, I PRESUME) AND OTHERS WATCHED THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE GALLERY ROOM.


I WENT TO MY USUAL SEAT, SITTING 4 OR 5 FEET ACROSS FROM AIRL. I PRESENTED THE ENVELOPE OF TRANSCRIPTS TO AIRL, AND PASSED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE SECRETARY, TELEPATHICALLY. AIRL LOOKED AT ME, AND LOOKED AT THE ENVELOPE, WITHOUT ACCEPTING IT.


AIRL SAID:

"IF YOU HAVE READ THEM AND THEY ARE ACCURATE IN YOU OWN ESTIMATION, THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO REVIEW THEM ALSO. THE TRANSLATIONS ARE CORRECT. YOU CAN TELL YOUR COMMANDER THAT YOU HAVE FAITHFULLY CONVEYED A RECORD OF OUR COMMUNICATION."

I ASSURED AIRL THAT I HAD READ THEM, AND THEY WERE EXACT RECORDINGS OF EVERYTHING I TOLD THE TRANSCRIPTION TYPIST.

"WILL YOU SIGN THE COVER PAGE THEN?", I ASKED.
"NO, I WILL NOT.", SAID AIRL.
"MAY I ASK WHY NOT?", I SAID.

I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHY SHE WASN'T WILLING TO DO SUCH A SIMPLE THING.

"IF YOUR COMMANDER DOES NOT TRUST HIS OWN STAFF TO MAKE AN HONEST AND ACCURATE REPORT TO HIM, WHAT CONFIDENCE WILL MY SIGNATURE ON THE PAGE GIVE HIM? WHY WILL HE TRUST AN INK MARK ON A PAGE MADE BY AN OFFICER OF THE DOMAIN, IF HE DOES NOT TRUST HIS OWN, LOYAL STAFF?"

I DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.

 

I COULDN'T ARGUE WITH AIRL'S LOGIC, AND I COULDN'T FORCE HER TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT EITHER. I SAT IN MY CHAIR FOR A MINUTE WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT. I THANKED AIRL AND TOLD HER I NEEDED TO GO ASK MY SUPERIORS FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. I PLACED THE ENVELOPE OF THE TRANSCRIPTS IN THE INSIDE BREAST POCKET OF MY UNIFORM JACKET AND BEGAN TO RISE FROM MY CHAIR.


AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR FROM THE GALLERY ROOM SLAMMED OPEN! FIVE HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY POLICE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM! A MAN IN A WHITE LABORATORY COAT FOLLOWED CLOSELY BEHIND THEM. HE PUSHED A SMALL CART THAT CARRIED A BOX-SHAPED MACHINE WITH A LOT OF DIALS ON THE FACE OF IT.


BEFORE I COULD REACT, TWO OF THE MPS GRABBED AIRL AND HELD HER FIRMLY DOWN IN THE OVERSTUFFED CHAIR SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ON SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR INTERVIEWS TOGETHER. THE TWO OTHER MPS GRABBED MY SHOULDERS AND PUSHED ME BACK DOWN ON MY CHAIR AND HELD ME THERE. THE OTHER MP STOOD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF AIRL, POINTING A RIFLE DIRECTLY AT HER, NOT MORE THAN SIX INCHES FROM HER HEAD.


THE MAN IN THE LAB COAT QUICKLY WHEELED THE CART BEHIND AIRL'S CHAIR. HE DEFTLY PLACED A CIRCULAR HEAD BAND OVER AIRL'S HEAD AND TURNED BACK TO THE MACHINE ON THE CART.

 

SUDDENLY, HE SHOUTED THE WORD "CLEAR!"


THE SOLDIERS WHO WERE HOLDING AIRL RELEASED HER. AT THAT INSTANT I SAW AIRL'S BODY STIFFEN AND SHUDDER. THIS LASTED FOR ABOUT 15 OR 20 SECONDS. THE MACHINE OPERATOR TURNED A KNOB ON THE MACHINE AND AIRL'S BODY SLUMPED BACK INTO THE CHAIR. AFTER A FEW SECONDS HE TURNED THE KNOB AGAIN AND AIRL'S BODY STIFFENED AS BEFORE. HE REPEATED THE SAME PROCESS SEVERAL MORE TIMES.


I SAT IN MY CHAIR, BEING HELD DOWN ALL THE WHILE BY THE MPS. AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS TERRIFIED AND TRANSFIXED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING! I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!


AFTER A FEW MINUTES SEVERAL OTHER MEN WEARING WHITE LAB COATS ENTERED THE ROOM. THEY BRIEFLY EXAMINED AIRL WHO WAS NOW SLUMPED LISTLESSLY IN THE CHAIR. THEY MUMBLED A FEW WORDS TO EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE MEN WAVED TO THE GALLERY WINDOW. A GURNEY WAS IMMEDIATELY ROLLED INTO THE ROOM BY TWO ATTENDANTS. THESE MEN LIFTED AIRL'S LIMP BODY ONTO THE GURNEY, STRAPPED HER DOWN ACROSS HER CHEST AND ARMS, AND ROLLED IT OUT OF THE ROOM.
 

I WAS IMMEDIATELY ESCORTED OUT OF THE INTERVIEW ROOM BY THE MPS AND TAKEN DIRECTLY TO MY QUARTERS, WHERE I WAS LOCKED IN MY ROOM WITH THE MPS REMAINING AT GUARD OUTSIDE THE DOOR.


AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR TO MY QUARTERS. WHEN I OPENED IT GENERAL TWINING ENTERED, TOGETHER WITH THE MACHINE OPERATOR IN THE WHITE LAB COAT. THE GENERAL INTRODUCED THE MAN TO ME AS DR. WILCOX. 235 (FOOTNOTE). HE ASKED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND THE DOCTOR.

 

WE LEFT THE ROOM, FOLLOWED BY THE MPS. AFTER SEVERAL TWISTS AND TURNS THROUGH THE COMPLEX WE ENTERED A SMALL ROOM WHERE AIRL HAD BEEN WHEELED ON THE GURNEY.


THE GENERAL TOLD ME THAT AIRL AND THE DOMAIN WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A VERY GREAT MILITARY THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES. AIRL HAD BEEN "IMMOBILIZED" SO THAT SHE COULD NOT DEPART AND RETURN TO HER BASE, AS SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO IN THE INTERVIEW. IT WOULD BE A VERY GRAVE RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITY TO ALLOW AIRL TO REPORT WHAT SHE OBSERVED DURING HER TIME AT THE BASE. SO, IT HAD BEEN DETERMINED THAT DECISIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED TO PREVENT THIS.
 

THE GENERAL ASKED ME IF I UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS WAS NECESSARY.

 

I SAID THAT I DID, ALTHOUGH I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT AGREE THAT IT WAS THE LEAST BIT NECESSARY AND I CERTAINLY DID NOT AGREE WITH THE "SURPRISE ATTACK" ON AIRL AND ME IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM! HOWEVER, I SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS TO THE GENERAL BECAUSE I WAS VERY AFRAID OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME AND AIRL IF I PROTESTED.


DR. WILCOX ASKED ME TO APPROACH THE GURNEY AND STAND NEXT TO AIRL. AIRL LAY PERFECTLY STILL AND UNMOVING ON THE BED. I COULD NOT TELL WHETHER SHE WAS ALIVE OR DEAD. SEVERAL OTHER MEN IN WHITE LAB COATS, WHO I ASSUMED WERE ALSO DOCTORS, STOOD ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BED. THEY HAD CONNECTED TWO PIECES OF MONITORING EQUIPMENT TO AIRL'S HEAD, ARMS AND CHEST.

 

ONE OF THESE DEVICES I RECOGNIZED FROM MY TRAINING AS A SURGICAL NURSE AS AN EEG MACHINE 236 (FOOTNOTE) WHICH IS USED TO DETECT ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN. THE OTHER DEVICE WAS A NORMAL HOSPITAL ROOM VITAL SIGNS MONITOR, WHICH I KNEW WOULD BE USELESS SINCE AIRL DID NOT HAVE A BIOLOGICAL BODY.


DR. WILCOX EXPLAINED TO ME THAT HE HAD ADMINISTERED A SERIES OF "MILD" ELECTROSHOCKS TO AIRL IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE HER LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES TIME TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION AND DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH AIRL.


HE ASKED ME TO ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH AIRL, TELEPATHICALLY.


I TRIED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BUT COULDN'T SENSE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM AIRL. I COULDN'T EVEN SENSE WHETHER AIRL WAS PRESENT IN THE BODY ANY LONGER!

"I THINK YOU MUST HAVE KILLED HER", I SAID TO THE DOCTOR.

DR. WILCOX TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD KEEP AIRL UNDER OBSERVATION AND THAT I WOULD BE ASKED TO RETURN LATER TO TRY TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH AIRL AGAIN."

231 "... GENERAL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, ... "
"SOON AFTER THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR AND THE US ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR II, DOOLITTLE WAS PROMOTED TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL ON JANUARY 2, 1942, AND WENT TO HEADQUARTERS ARMY AIR FORCE TO PLAN THE FIRST AERIAL RAID ON THE JAPANESE HOMELAND. HE VOLUNTEERED AND RECEIVED GEN. H.H. ARNOLD'S APPROVAL TO LEAD THE ATTACK OF 16 B-25 MEDIUM BOMBERS FROM THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS HORNET, WITH TARGETS IN TOKYO, KOBE, OSAKA, AND NAGOYA. IT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY COMBAT MISSION OF HIS MILITARY CAREER.


DOOLITTLE RECEIVED THE MEDAL OF HONOR, PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR PLANNING AND LEADING THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. THE DOOLITTLE RAID IS VIEWED BY HISTORIANS AS A MAJOR PUBLIC-RELATIONS VICTORY FOR THE UNITED STATES. ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE TO JAPANESE WAR INDUSTRY WAS MINOR, THE RAID SHOWED THE JAPANESE THEIR HOMELAND WAS NOT INVULNERABLE.


DOOLITTLE WAS PORTRAYED BY SPENCER TRACY IN THE 1944 FILM THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO AND BY ALEC BALDWIN IN THE 2001 FILM PEARL HARBOR, IN WHICH THE DOOLITTLE RAID WAS DEPICTED.


ON MAY 10, 1946, DOOLITTLE REVERTED TO INACTIVE RESERVE STATUS AND RETURNED TO SHELL OIL AS A VICE PRESIDENT, AND LATER AS A DIRECTOR. HE WAS THE HIGHEST-RANKING RESERVE OFFICER TO SERVE IN THE U.S. MILITARY IN WORLD WAR II."

234 "... CHARLES LINDBERGH WAS ALSO IN THE OFFICE..."
"CHARLES LINDBERGH GAINED SUDDEN GREAT INTERNATIONAL FAME AS THE FIRST PILOT TO FLY SOLO ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. HE FLEW FROM ROOSEVELT AIRFIELD IN GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK, TO PARIS (LE BOURGET AIRPORT) ON 20 MAY - 21 MAY 1927 IN 33.5 HOURS. HIS PLANE WAS THE SINGLE-ENGINE AIRCRAFT, THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS.


LINDBERGH'S ACCOMPLISHMENT WON HIM THE ORTEIG PRIZE; MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE PRIZE MONEY WAS THE ACCLAIM THAT RESULTED FROM HIS DARING FLIGHT. A TICKER-TAPE PARADE WAS HELD FOR HIM DOWN 5TH AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY ON 13 JUNE 1927.


HIS PUBLIC STATURE FOLLOWING THIS FLIGHT WAS SUCH THAT HE BECAME AN IMPORTANT VOICE ON BEHALF OF AVIATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR AERONAUTICS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE MASSIVE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING HIM AND HIS FLIGHT BOOSTED THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY AND MADE A SKEPTICAL PUBLIC TAKE AIR TRAVEL SERIOUSLY. LINDBERGH IS RECOGNIZED IN AVIATION FOR DEMONSTRATING AND CHARTING POLAR AIR-ROUTES, HIGH ALTITUDE FLYING TECHNIQUES, AND INCREASING AIRCRAFT FLYING RANGE BY DECREASING FUEL CONSUMPTION. THESE INNOVATIONS ARE THE BASIS OF MODERN INTERCONTINENTAL AIR TRAVEL.


IN HIS SIX MONTHS DURING WW II IN THE PACIFIC IN 1944, LINDBERGH TOOK PART IN FIGHTER BOMBER RAIDS ON JAPANESE POSITIONS, FLYING ABOUT 50 COMBAT MISSIONS (AS A CIVILIAN). THE U.S. MARINE AND ARMY AIR FORCE PILOTS WHO SERVED WITH LINDBERGH ADMIRED AND RESPECTED HIM, PRAISING HIS COURAGE AND DEFENDING HIS PATRIOTISM.


AFTER WORLD WAR II HE LIVED QUIETLY IN CONNECTICUT AS A CONSULTANT BOTH TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND TO PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS. HIS 1953 BOOK THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS, RECOUNTING HIS NON-STOP TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT, WON THE PULITZER PRIZE IN 1954.


DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER RESTORED LINDBERGH S ASSIGNMENT WITH THE ARMY AIR CORPS AND MADE HIM A BRIGADIER GENERAL IN 1954. IN THAT YEAR, HE SERVED ON THE CONGRESSIONAL ADVISORY PANEL SET UP TO ESTABLISH THE SITE OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY. IN DECEMBER 1968, HE VISITED THE CREW OF APOLLO 8 ON THE EVE OF THE FIRST MANNED SPACEFLIGHT TO LEAVE EARTH ORBIT.


FROM THE 1960S ON, LINDBERGH BECAME AN ADVOCATE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE NATURAL WORLD, CAMPAIGNING TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE HUMPBACK AND BLUE WHALES, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING PROTECTIONS FOR THE "PRIMITIVE" FILIPINO GROUP THE TASADAY AND AFRICAN TRIBES, AND SUPPORTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL PARK. WHILE STUDYING THE NATIVE FLORA AND FAUNA OF THE PHILIPPINES, HE ALSO BECAME INVOLVED IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE PHILIPPINE EAGLE.


IN HIS FINAL YEARS, LINDBERGH BECAME TROUBLED THAT THE WORLD WAS OUT OF BALANCE WITH ITS NATURAL ENVIRONMENT; HE STRESSED THE NEED TO REGAIN THAT BALANCE, AND SPOKE AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF SUPERSONIC AIRLINERS.


LINDBERGH S SPEECHES AND WRITINGS LATER IN LIFE EMPHASIZED HIS LOVE OF BOTH TECHNOLOGY AND NATURE, AND A LIFELONG BELIEF THAT "ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MANKIND HAVE VALUE ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY PRESERVE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE."


IN A 1967 LIFE MAGAZINE ARTICLE, HE SAID, "THE HUMAN FUTURE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO COMBINE THE KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE WITH THE WISDOM OF WILDNESS."

PAUL H. WILCOX, M. D. THE TRAVERSE CITY STATE HOSPITAL, TRAVERSE CITY, MICHIGAN.


IS THE AUTHOR OF THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE, PUBLISHED IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY IN AUGUST OF 1947:

"A REVIEW OF OVER 23,000 TREATMENTS USING UNIDIRECTIONAL CURRENTS
1. FORTY PERCENT OF THE MOST CHRONIC PATIENTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN WARD BEHAVIOR IF ADEQUATELY AND REPEATEDLY TREATED WITH SUITABLE TYPE OF ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY. RELAPSES MUST BE TREATED WHENEVER THEY OCCUR OVER MONTHS AND YEARS.
2. AT LEAST 60% OF EARLY CASES, AGED 60 OR UNDER, WERE REHABILITATED WITHIN 1 YEAR WHEN ADEQUATELY TREATED AND 65% BY THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THE START OF TREATMENT.
3. ADEQUATE TREATMENT MEANS INTENSIVE TREATMENT UNTIL THE EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED AND INTENSIVE TREATMENT OF RELAPSES WHEN THEY OCCUR. NO PATIENT, OTHERWISE SUITABLE WHO STILL IS NOT REHABILITATED AFTER 1 YEAR, HAS HAD AN ADEQUATE TRIAL OF TREATMENT WITH LESS THAN 20 TREATMENTS.
4. AN IDEAL THERAPY IS ONE WHICH ACHIEVES BENEFICIAL RESULTS WITHOUT CAUSING ACCUMULATING BRAIN DAMAGE, THUS PERMITTING ITS USE REPEATEDLY FOR YEARS IF NECESSARY.
5. THIS IDEAL IS APPROACHED BY THE RELATIVELY LOW INTENSITY 60-CYCLE PULSATING DIRECT CURRENT USED IN THE TREATMENT OF THE PATIENTS REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER. THIS TECHNIQUE ALSO HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN EXCEPTIONALLY LOW PERCENTAGE OF SKELETAL COMPLICATIONS."
