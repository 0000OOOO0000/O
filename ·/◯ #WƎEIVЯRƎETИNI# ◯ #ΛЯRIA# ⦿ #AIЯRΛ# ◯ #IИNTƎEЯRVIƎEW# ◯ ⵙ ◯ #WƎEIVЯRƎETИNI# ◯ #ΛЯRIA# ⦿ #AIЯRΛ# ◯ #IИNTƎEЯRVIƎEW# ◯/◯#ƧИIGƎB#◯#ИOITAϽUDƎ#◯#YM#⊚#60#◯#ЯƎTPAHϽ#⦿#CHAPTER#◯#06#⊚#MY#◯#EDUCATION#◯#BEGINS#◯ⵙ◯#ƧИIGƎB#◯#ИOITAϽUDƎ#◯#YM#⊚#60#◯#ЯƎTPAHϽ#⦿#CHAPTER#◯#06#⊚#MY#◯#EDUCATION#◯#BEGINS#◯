CHAPTER SIX - MY EDUCATION BEGINS
 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"BY THE 15TH DAY AFTER "RESCUING" AIRL FROM THE CRASH SITE, I WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE FLUIDLY AND EFFORTLESSLY WITH HER IN ENGLISH. SHE HAD ABSORBED SO MUCH WRITTEN MATERIAL BY THIS TIME THAT HER ACADEMIC EDUCATION FAR EXCEEDED MY OWN. ALTHOUGH I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES IN 1940 AND ATTENDED COLLEGE FOR FOUR YEARS OF PREMEDICAL AND NURSING TRAINING, THE VARIETY OF MY OWN READING HAD BEEN FAIRLY LIMITED.


I HAD NOT STUDIED MOST OF THE SUBJECTS TO WHICH AIRL HAD NOW BEEN EXPOSED, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HER ACUTE UNDERSTANDING, VERY INTENSE STUDY HABITS AND A NEARLY PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY! SHE WAS ABLE TO RECALL LONG PASSAGES FROM BOOKS SHE READ. SHE WAS ESPECIALLY FOND OF SECTIONS OF HER FAVORITE STORIES FROM CLASSIC LITERATURE LIKE THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN 46 (FOOTNOTE), TALES FROM GULLIVER'S TRAVELS 47 (FOOTNOTE) AND PETER PAN 48 (FOOTNOTE) AND THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW 49 (FOOTNOTE).


BY THIS TIME AIRL HAD BECOME THE TEACHER, AND I WAS THE STUDENT. I WAS ABOUT TO LEARN WHAT MEN OF EARTH DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING!
THE THRONG OF SCIENTISTS AND AGENTS WHO OBSERVED US THROUGH THE ONE-WAY GLASS OF OUR INTERVIEW ROOM, WHOM AIRL AND I NOW REFERRED TO AS "THE GALLERY", WERE GROWING INCREASINGLY IMPATIENT TO ASK HER QUESTIONS. BUT AIRL CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO ALLOW ANY QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED OF HER BY ANYONE OTHER THAN MYSELF, EVEN VICARIOUSLY THROUGH ME AS AN INTERPRETER, OR IN WRITING.


ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 16TH DAY AIRL AND I SAT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AS SHE READ. SHE CLOSED THE LAST PAGE OF A BOOK SHE WAS READING AND PLACED IT ASIDE. I WAS ABOUT TO HAND HER THE NEXT BOOK FROM A LARGE PILE WAITING TO BE READ, WHEN SHE TURNED AND SAID OR "THOUGHT" TO ME, "I AM READY TO SPEAK NOW". AT FIRST I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE REMARK. I GESTURED FOR HER TO CONTINUE AND SHE BEGAN TO TEACH ME MY FIRST LESSON."

 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)
TOP SECRET
OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD, 50 9TH BOMB GROUP

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 24. 7. 1947, 1ST SESSION


"WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY, AIRL?", I ASKED.


"I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE IN THIS SECTOR OF SPACE FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS. HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY HAD INTIMATE CONTACT WITH BEINGS ON EARTH SINCE 5,965 BCE. IT IS NOT MY PRIMARY FUNCTION TO INTERACT WITH INHABITANTS OF PLANETS WITHIN THE DOMAIN. I AM AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER, WITH MANY DUTIES TO PERFORM. NONETHELESS, ALTHOUGH I AM FLUENT IN 347 OTHER LANGUAGES WITHIN THE DOMAIN, I HAVE NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO YOUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE.


THE LAST EARTH LANGUAGE WITH WHICH I WAS CONVERSANT WAS THE SANSKRIT LANGUAGE OF THE VEDIC HYMNS. 50 (FOOTNOTE) AT THAT TIME I WAS A MEMBER OF A MISSION SENT TO INVESTIGATE THE LOSS OF A DOMAIN BASE LOCATED IN THE HIMALAYA MOUNTAINS. AN ENTIRE BATTALION OF OFFICERS, PILOTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL DISAPPEARED AND THE BASE DESTROYED.


SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO I WAS TRAINED AND SERVED AS AN INVESTIGATION, DATA EVALUATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OFFICER FOR THE DOMAIN. BECAUSE I WAS EXPERIENCED IN THAT TECHNOLOGY, I WAS SENT TO EARTH AS PART OF THE SEARCH TEAM. ONE OF MY DUTIES INVOLVED INTERROGATION OF THE HUMAN POPULATION THAT INHABITED THE ADJOINING AREA AT THAT TIME. 51 (FOOTNOTE) MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT REGION REPORTED SIGHTING "VIMANAS" OR SPACE CRAFT IN THE AREA. 52 (FOOTNOTE)


FOLLOWING THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF EVIDENCE, TESTIMONY, OBSERVATION, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE, I LED MY TEAM TO THE DISCOVERY THAT THERE WERE STILL "OLD EMPIRE" SHIPS AND WELL-HIDDEN "OLD EMPIRE" INSTALLATIONS IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY UNAWARE.


YOU AND I WERE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN YOUR LANGUAGE BECAUSE I, PERSONALLY, HAVE NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO YOUR LANGUAGE. HOWEVER, NOW THAT I HAVE SCANNED THE BOOKS AND MATERIAL YOU PROVIDED ME THIS DATA HAS BEEN RELAYED TO OUR SPACE STATION IN THIS REGION AND PROCESSED BY OUR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER THROUGH OUR COMPUTERS. IT HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MY OWN LANGUAGE AND RELAYED BACK TO ME IN A CONTEXT THAT I CAN THINK WITH. I HAVE ALSO RECEIVED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE FILES STORED IN OUR COMPUTERS ABOUT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND DOMAIN RECORDS CONCERNING EARTH CIVILIZATION." 53 (FOOTNOTE)


"NOW I AM PREPARED TO GIVE YOU CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT I FEEL WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE TO YOU. I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH. ALTHOUGH TRUTH IS RELATIVE TO ALL OTHER TRUTH, I WISH TO SHARE WITH YOU AS HONESTLY AND ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE, TRUTH AS I SEE IT, WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF MY INTEGRITY TO MYSELF, TO MY RACE AND WITHOUT VIOLATING MY OBLIGATIONS TO THE ORGANIZATION I SERVE AND HAVE SWORN TO UPHOLD AND PROTECT".


"OK", I THOUGHT. "WILL YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE GALLERY NOW?"


"NO. I WILL NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS. I WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO YOU THAT I THINK WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS WHO COMPRISE HUMANITY, AND THAT WILL FOSTER THE SURVIVAL OF ALL THE MYRIAD LIFE FORMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF EARTH, AS IT IS A PART OF MY MISSION TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF EARTH.


"PERSONALLY, IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT ALL SENTIENT BEINGS ARE IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS. THIS INCLUDES HUMAN BEINGS. FOR THE SAKE OF ACCURACY AND SIMPLICITY I WILL USE A MADE-UP WORD: "IS-BE". BECAUSE THE PRIMARY NATURE OF AN IMMORTAL BEING IS THAT THEY LIVE IN A TIMELESS STATE OF "IS", AND THE ONLY REASON FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IS THAT THEY DECIDE TO "BE".


NO MATTER HOW LOWLY THEIR STATION IN A SOCIETY, EVERY IS-BE DESERVES THE RESPECT AND TREATMENT THAT I MYSELF WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE FROM OTHERS. EACH PERSON ON EARTH CONTINUES TO BE AN IS-BE WHETHER THEY ARE AWARE OF THE FACT OR NOT."


(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
(I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS CONVERSATION. HER TONE WAS VERY MATTER-OF-FACT AND EMOTIONLESS. HOWEVER, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SENSED THE PRESENCE OF A WARM AND REAL "PERSONALITY" IN AIRL. HER REFERENCE TO "IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS" STRUCK ME LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHT IN A DARK ROOM. I HAD NEVER BEFORE CONSIDERED THAT A HUMAN BEING COULD BE AN IMMORTAL BEING.


I THOUGHT THAT STATUS OR POWER WAS RESERVED SOLELY FOR THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST. AND, BECAUSE I AM A DEVOUT CATHOLIC AND SUBJECT TO THE WORD JESUS, AND THE HOLY FATHER, I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF A WOMAN AS AN IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEING EITHER - NOT EVEN THE HOLY MOTHER MARY. YET, WHEN AIRL THOUGHT THAT THOUGHT, I BECAME VIVIDLY AWARE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT SHE, PERSONALLY, WAS AN IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEING, AND SO ARE WE ALL!


AIRL SAID THAT SHE SENSED THAT I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE IDEA. SHE SAID SHE WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO ME THAT I AM ALSO AN IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEING. SHE SAID, "BE ABOVE YOUR BODY!" IMMEDIATELY, I REALIZED THAT I WAS "OUTSIDE" OF MY BODY, LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CEILING AT THE TOP OF MY BODY'S HEAD! 54 (FOOTNOTE) I WAS ALSO ABLE TO SEE THE ROOM AROUND ME, INCLUDING AIRL'S BODY SITTING IN THE CHAIR NEXT TO MY OWN BODY. AFTER A MOMENT, I REALIZED THE SIMPLE, BUT SHOCKING, REALITY, THAT "I" AM NOT A BODY.


IN THAT MOMENT A BLACK VEIL LIFTED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, AND FOR A VERY LONG TIME INTO THE PAST, I REALIZED THAT I AM NOT "MY SOUL", BUT THAT "I" AM "ME" A SPIRITUAL BEING. THIS WAS AN UNEXPLAINABLE EPIPHANY, BUT ONE THAT FILLS ME WITH A JOY AND RELIEF I CANNOT RECALL HAVING EXPERIENCED EVER BEFORE. AS FOR THE "IMMORTAL" PART, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HER MEANING, AS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TAUGHT THAT I AM NOT IMMORTAL - A SPIRIT, PERHAPS - BUT CERTAINLY NOT IMMORTAL!


AFTER A MOMENT - I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG - AIRL ASKED ME IF I HAD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IDEA. SUDDENLY, I WAS BACK INSIDE MY BODY AGAIN, AND SAID OUT LOUD, "YES! I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN!".


I WAS SO TAKEN ABACK BY THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD TO GET UP FROM MY CHAIR AND WALK AROUND THE ROOM FOR A FEW MINUTES. I MADE AN EXCUSE THAT I NEEDED TO GET A DRINK OF WATER, AND GO TO THE RESTROOM, WHICH I DID. IN THE RESTROOM I LOOKED AT MY "SELF" IN THE MIRROR. I USED THE TOILET, REFRESHED MY MAKE-UP, AND STRAIGHTENED MY UNIFORM. AFTER 10 OR 15 MINUTES I FELT MORE "NORMAL" AGAIN AND RETURNED TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM.


AFTER THAT I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS NO LONGER JUST AN INTERPRETER FOR AIRL. I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS A "KINDRED SPIRIT". I FELT LIKE I WAS SAFE, AT HOME, WITH A TRUSTED FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER, AS CLOSE AS ANY I HAVE EVER HAD. AIRL SENSED AND UNDERSTOOD MY CONFUSION ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF "PERSONAL IMMORTALITY".

 

SHE BEGAN HER FIRST "LESSON" WITH ME BY EXPLAINING THIS TO ME."

 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW CONTINUED)


"AIRL TOLD ME HER REASONS FOR COMING TO EARTH AND FOR BEING IN THE AREA OF THE 509TH BOMBER SQUADRON. SHE WAS SENT BY HER SUPERIOR OFFICERS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPLOSIONS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH HAVE BEEN TESTED IN NEW MEXICO. HER SUPERIORS ORDERED HER TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THAT COULD BE USED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF RADIATION AND POTENTIAL HARM THIS MIGHT CAUSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. DURING HER MISSION, THE SPACE CRAFT WAS STRUCK BY A LIGHTING 55 (FOOTNOTE), WHICH CAUSED HER TO LOSE CONTROL AND CRASH.


THE SPACE CRAFT IS OPERATED BY IS-BES WHO USE "DOLL BODIES" IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT AN ACTOR WEARS A MASK AND COSTUME. IT IS A LIKE A MECHANICAL TOOL THROUGH WHICH TO OPERATE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD. SHE, AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER IS-BES OF THE OFFICER CLASS AND THEIR SUPERIORS, INHABIT THESE "DOLL BODIES" WHEN THEY ARE ON DUTY IN SPACE. WHEN THEY ARE NOT ON DUTY, THEY "LEAVE" THE BODY AND OPERATE, THINK, COMMUNICATE, TRAVEL, AND EXIST WITHOUT THE USE OF A BODY.


THE BODIES ARE CONSTRUCTED OF SYNTHETIC MATERIALS, INCLUDING A VERY SENSITIVE ELECTRICAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, TO WHICH EACH IS-BE ADJUSTS THEMSELVES OR "TUNE IN" TO AN ELECTRONIC WAVE LENGTH 56 (FOOTNOTE) THAT IS MATCHED UNIQUELY TO THE WAVELENGTH OR FREQUENCY EMITTED BY EACH IS-BE.

 

EACH IS-BE IS CAPABLE OF CREATING A UNIQUE WAVE FREQUENCY WHICH IDENTIFIES THEM, MUCH LIKE A RADIO SIGNAL FREQUENCY. THIS SERVES, IN PART, AS IDENTIFICATION LIKE A FINGER PRINT. THE DOLL BODY ACTS LIKE A RADIO RECEIVER FOR THE IS-BE. NO TWO FREQUENCIES OR DOLL BODIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.


THE BODIES OF EACH IS-BE CREW MEMBER ARE LIKEWISE TUNED INTO AND CONNECTED TO THE "NERVOUS SYSTEM" BUILT INTO THE SPACE CRAFT. THE SPACE CRAFT IS BUILT IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THE DOLL BODY. IT IS ADJUSTED SPECIFICALLY TO THE FREQUENCY OF EACH IS-BE CREW MEMBER. THEREFORE, THE CRAFT CAN BE OPERATED BY THE "THOUGHTS" OR ENERGY EMITTED BY THE IS-BE. IT IS REALLY A VERY SIMPLE, DIRECT CONTROL SYSTEM. SO, THERE ARE NO COMPLICATED CONTROLS OR NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT ON BOARD THE SPACE CRAFT. THEY OPERATE AS AN EXTENSION OF THE IS-BE.


WHEN THE LIGHTNING BOLT STRUCK THE SPACE CRAFT THIS CAUSED A SHORT CIRCUIT AND CONSEQUENTLY "DISCONNECTED" THEM FROM THE CONTROL OF THE SHIP MOMENTARILY WHICH RESULTED IN THE CRASH.


AIRL WAS, AND STILL IS, AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER IN AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WHICH IS PART OF A SPACE OPERA 57 (FOOTNOTE) CIVILIZATION WHICH REFERS TO ITSELF AS "THE DOMAIN". THIS CIVILIZATION CONTROLS A VAST NUMBER OF GALAXIES, STARS, PLANETS, MOONS AND ASTEROIDS THROUGHOUT AN AREA OF SPACE THAT IS APPROXIMATELY ONE-FOURTH OF THE ENTIRE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE!

 

THE CONTINUING MISSION OF HER ORGANIZATION IS TO "SECURE, CONTROL AND EXPAND THE TERRITORY AND RESOURCES OF THE DOMAIN".


AIRL POINTED OUT THAT THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES WERE VERY SIMILAR IN MANY WAYS TO THE EUROPEAN EXPLORERS WHO "DISCOVERED" AND "CLAIMED" THE NEW WORLD FOR THE HOLY FATHER, THE POPE AND FOR THE KINGS OF SPAIN, PORTUGAL AND LATER, HOLLAND, ENGLAND, FRANCE AND SO FORTH.

 

EUROPE BENEFITED FROM THE PROPERTY "ACQUIRED" FROM THE NATIVE INHABITANTS. HOWEVER, THE NATIVE INHABITANTS WERE NEVER CONSULTED WITH OR ASKED FOR THEIR PERMISSION TO BECOME A PART OF THE "DOMAIN" OF EUROPEAN NATIONS AND THE SOLDIERS AND PRIESTS THEY SENT TO ACQUIRE TERRITORY AND WEALTH IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS.


AIRL SAID SHE READ IN A HISTORY BOOK THAT THE SPANISH KING REGRETTED THE BRUTAL TREATMENT OF THE NATIVE INHABITANTS BY HIS SOLDIERS. HE FEARED RETRIBUTION FROM THE GODS HE WORSHIPPED, AS DESCRIBED IN THE VARIOUS TESTAMENTS OF THE BIBLE. HE ASKED THE POPE TO PREPARE A STATEMENT CALLED "THE REQUIREMENT" 58 (FOOTNOTE) WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE READ TO EACH OF THE NEWLY ENCOUNTERED NATIVE INHABITANTS.
 

THE KING HOPED THAT THE STATEMENT, WHETHER IT WAS ACCEPTED OR REJECTED BY THE NATIVES, WOULD ABSOLVE THE KING OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESULTING SLAUGHTER AND ENSLAVEMENT OF THESE PEOPLE. HE USED THIS STATEMENT AS JUSTIFICATION TO CONFISCATE THEIR LANDS AND POSSESSIONS BY HIS SOLDIERS AND THE POPE'S PRIESTS. APPARENTLY, THE POPE, PERSONALLY, DID NOT HAVE ANY FEELINGS OF GUILT OR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MATTER.


AIRL THOUGHT THAT SUCH ACTIONS WERE THOSE OF A COWARD AND THAT IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE TERRITORY OF SPAIN WAS DIMINISHED SO QUICKLY. ONLY A FEW YEARS LATER THE KING WAS DEAD AND HIS EMPIRE HAD BEEN ASSIMILATED BY OTHER NATIONS.


AIRL SAID THAT THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE DOMAIN. THEIR LEADERS ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE DOMAIN, AND WOULD NOT DENIGRATE THEMSELVES IN THIS FASHION. NOR DO THEY FEAR ANY GODS OR HAVE ANY REGRET FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THIS IDEA REINFORCES MY EARLIER SUGGESTION THAT AIRL AND HER PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY ATHEISTS.


IN THE CASE OF THE ACQUISITION OF EARTH BY THE DOMAIN, THE RULERS OF THE DOMAIN HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO OPENLY REVEAL THIS INTENTION TO THE "NATIVE INHABITANTS" OF EARTH UNTIL A LATER TIME WHEN IT MAY, OR MAY NOT, SUIT THEIR INTERESTS TO REVEAL THEMSELVES. FOR THE PRESENT TIME, IT IS NOT STRATEGICALLY NECESSARY TO MAKE THE PRESENCE OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE KNOWN TO MANKIND. IN FACT, UNTIL NOW, IT HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVELY HIDDEN, FOR REASONS THAT WILL BE REVEALED LATER.


THE ASTEROID BELT NEAR EARTH IS A VERY SMALL, BUT IMPORTANT LOCATION FOR THE DOMAIN IN THIS PART OF SPACE. ACTUALLY, SOME OF THE OBJECTS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM ARE VERY VALUABLE FOR USE AS LOW-GRAVITY "SPACE STATIONS". THEY ARE INTERESTED PRIMARILY IN THE LOW GRAVITY SATELLITES IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF THE SIDE OF THE MOON FACING AWAY FROM EARTH 59 (FOOTNOTE) AND THE ASTEROID BELT, WHICH WAS A PLANET THAT WAS DESTROYED BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, AND TO A LESSER DEGREE, MARS AND VENUS.

 

DOOM STRUCTURES SYNTHESIZED FROM GYPSUM 60 (FOOTNOTE) OR UNDERGROUND BASES COVERED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE SCREENS 61 (FOOTNOTE) ARE EASILY CONSTRUCTED TO HOUSE THE DOMAIN FORCES.


ONCE AN AREA OF SPACE IS ACQUIRED BY THE DOMAIN AND BECOMES A PART OF THE TERRITORY UNDER ITS CONTROL, IT IS TREATED AS THE "PROPERTY" OF THE DOMAIN. THE SPACE STATION NEAR THE PLANET EARTH IS IMPORTANT ONLY BECAUSE IT LAY ALONG A PATH OF THE DOMAIN EXPANSION ROUTE TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY AND BEYOND.

 

OF COURSE, EVERYONE IN THE DOMAIN IS AWARE OF THIS -EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE OF EARTH."

"ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1884) (OFTEN SHORTENED TO HUCK FINN) BY MARK TWAIN. THE BOOK IS NOTED FOR ITS INNOCENT YOUNG PROTAGONIST, ITS COLORFUL DESCRIPTION OF PEOPLE AND PLACES ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, AND ITS SOBER AND OFTEN SCATHING LOOK AT ENTRENCHED ATTITUDES, PARTICULARLY RACISM. THE DRIFTING JOURNEY OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN AND HIS FRIEND, RUNAWAY SLAVE JIM, DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THEIR RAFT MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING IMAGES OF ESCAPE AND FREEDOM IN ALL OF AMERICAN LITERATURE."

47 "... GULLIVER'S TRAVELS ..."
"GULLIVER'S TRAVELS (1726, AMENDED 1735), OFFICIALLY TRAVELS INTO SEVERAL REMOTE NATIONS OF THE WORLD, IN FOUR PARTS. BY LEMUEL GULLIVER, FIRST A SURGEON, AND THEN A CAPTAIN OF SEVERAL SHIPS, IS A NOVEL BY JONATHAN SWIFT THAT IS BOTH A SATIRE ON HUMAN NATURE AND A PARODY OF THE "TRAVELLERS' TALES" LITERARY SUB-GENRE. IT IS SWIFT'S BEST KNOWN FULL-LENGTH WORK, AND A CLASSIC OF ENGLISH LITERATURE.

 

THE BOOK BECAME TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR AS SOON AS IT WAS PUBLISHED (JOHN GAY SAID IN A 1726 LETTER TO SWIFT THAT "IT IS UNIVERSALLY READ, FROM THE CABINET COUNCIL TO THE NURSERY"), AND IT IS LIKELY THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN OUT OF PRINT SINCE THEN. THE BOOK PRESENTS ITSELF AS A SIMPLE TRAVELLER'S NARRATIVE WITH THE DISINGENUOUS TITLE TRAVELS INTO SEVERAL REMOTE NATIONS OF THE WORLD, ITS AUTHORSHIP ASSIGNED ONLY TO "LEMUEL GULLIVER, FIRST A SURGEON, THEN A CAPTAIN OF SEVERAL SHIPS"."

48 "...PETER PAN..."
PETER PAN IS A CHARACTER CREATED BY SCOTTISH NOVELIST AND PLAYWRIGHT J. M. BARRIE (1860¬1937). A MISCHIEVOUS BOY WHO FLIES AND MAGICALLY REFUSES TO GROW UP, PETER PAN SPENDS HIS NEVER-ENDING CHILDHOOD ADVENTURING ON THE SMALL ISLAND OF NEVERLAND AS THE LEADER OF HIS GANG THE LOST BOYS, INTERACTING WITH FAIRIES AND PIRATES, AND FROM TIME TO TIME MEETING ORDINARY CHILDREN FROM THE WORLD OUTSIDE.


BARRIE NEVER DESCRIBED PETER'S APPEARANCE IN DETAIL, LEAVING MUCH OF IT TO THE IMAGINATION OF THE READER AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ANYONE ADAPTING THE CHARACTER. HE DESCRIBES HIM AS A BEAUTIFUL BOY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE, "CLAD IN SKELETON LEAVES AND THE JUICES THAT FLOW FROM TREES".


PETER IS MAINLY AN EXAGGERATED STEREOTYPE OF A BOASTFUL AND CARELESS BOY. HE IS QUICK TO POINT OUT HOW GREAT HE IS. PETER HAS A NONCHALANT, DEVIL-MAY-CARE ATTITUDE, AND IS FEARLESSLY COCKY WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING HIMSELF IN DANGER. BARRIE WRITES THAT WHEN PETER THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DIE ON MAROONER'S ROCK, HE FELT SCARED, YET HE FELT ONLY ONE SHUDDER RUN THROUGH HIM WHEN ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD'VE FELT SCARED UP UNTIL DEATH. WITH HIS BLISSFUL UNAWARENESS OF THE TRAGEDY OF DEATH, HE SAYS, "TO DIE WILL BE AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE".


PETER'S ARCHETYPAL ABILITY IS HIS REFUSAL TO GROW UP. BARRIE DID NOT EXPLAIN HOW HE WAS ABLE TO DO THIS, LEAVING THE IMPLICATION THAT IT WAS BY AN ACT OF WILL.


PETER IS A SKILLED SWORDSMAN, WITH THE SKILL TO RIVAL EVEN CAPTAIN HOOK, WHOSE HAND HE CUT OFF IN A DUEL. HE HAS REMARKABLY KEEN VISION AND HEARING. PETER PAN IS SAID TO BE ABLE TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING. PETER HAS AN EFFECT ON THE WHOLE OF NEVERLAND AND ITS INHABITANTS WHEN HE IS THERE. BARRIE STATES THAT THE ISLAND WAKES UP WHEN HE RETURNS FROM HIS TRIP TO LONDON. PETER IS THE LEADER OF THE LOST BOYS, A BAND OF BOYS WHO WERE LOST BY THEIR PARENTS, AND CAME TO LIVE IN NEVERLAND. HE IS FRIENDS WITH TINKER BELL, A COMMON FAIRY WHO IS OFTEN JEALOUSLY PROTECTIVE OF HIM."

49 "...THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW... "
"A SHORT STORY BY WASHINGTON IRVING CONTAINED IN HIS COLLECTION THE SKETCH BOOK OF GEOFFREY CRAYON, GENT., WRITTEN WHILE HE WAS LIVING IN BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND, AND FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1820. WITH IRVING'S COMPANION PIECE "RIP VAN WINKLE", "THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW" IS AMONG THE EARLIEST AMERICAN FICTION STILL READ TODAY.


THE STORY IS SET CIRCA 1790 IN THE DUTCH SETTLEMENT OF TARRY TOWN, NEW YORK, IN A SECLUDED GLEN CALLED SLEEPY HOLLOW. IT TELLS THE STORY OF ICHABOD CRANE, A LANKY SCHOOLMASTER FROM CONNECTICUT, WHO COMPETES WITH ABRAHAM "BROM BONES" VAN BRUNT, THE TOWN ROWDY, FOR THE HAND OF 18-YEAR-OLD KATRINA VAN TASSEL, ONLY DAUGHTER OF A WEALTHY FARMER.

 

AS CRANE LEAVES A PARTY AT THE VAN TASSEL HOME ON AN AUTUMN NIGHT, HE IS PURSUED BY THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN, SUPPOSEDLY THE GHOST OF A HESSIAN TROOPER WHO LOST HIS HEAD TO A CANNONBALL DURING "SOME NAMELESS BATTLE" OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND WHO "RIDES FORTH TO THE SCENE OF BATTLE IN NIGHTLY QUEST OF HIS HEAD." CRANE DISAPPEARS FROM TOWN, LEAVING KATRINA TO MARRY BROM BONES, WHO WAS "TO LOOK EXCEEDINGLY KNOWING WHENEVER THE STORY OF ICHABOD WAS RELATED."

50 "...SANSKRIT OF THE VEDIC HYMNS..."
"SANSKRIT (SA SK TA VAK, FOR SHORT SA SK TAM) IS A CLASSICAL LANGUAGE OF SOUTH ASIA, A LITURGICAL LANGUAGE OF HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, SIKHISM, JAINISM, AND ONE OF THE 23 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF INDIA.


ITS POSITION IN THE CULTURES OF SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA IS AKIN TO THAT OF LATIN AND GREEK IN EUROPE AND IT HAS EVOLVED INTO, AS WELL AS INFLUENCED, MANY MODERN-DAY LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD. IT APPEARS IN PRE-CLASSICAL FORM AS VEDIC SANSKRIT, WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE RIGVEDA BEING THE OLDEST AND MOST ARCHAIC STAGE PRESERVED. DATING BACK TO AS EARLY AS 1500 BCE, VEDIC SANSKRIT IS THE EARLIEST ATTESTED INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGE, AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST ATTESTED MEMBERS OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE FAMILY.


THE CORPUS OF SANSKRIT LITERATURE ENCOMPASSES A RICH TRADITION OF POETRY AND DRAMA AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS TEXTS. TODAY, SANSKRIT CONTINUES TO BE WIDELY USED AS A CEREMONIAL LANGUAGE IN HINDU RELIGIOUS RITUALS IN THE FORMS OF HYMNS AND MANTRAS. SPOKEN SANSKRIT IS STILL IN USE IN A FEW TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN INDIA, AND THERE ARE SOME ATTEMPTS AT REVIVAL.


THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THE CLASSICAL SANSKRIT LANGUAGE AS LAID OUT IN THE GRAMMAR OF PANINI, AROUND THE 4TH CENTURY BCE."

-- EDITOR'S NOTE: (THE WESTERN BORDERS OF PAKISTAN INCLUDE THE KHYBER PASS AND BOLAN PASS, TRADITIONAL INVASION ROUTES BETWEEN CENTRAL ASIA. THE CLOSEST CIVILIZATION USING SANSKRIT AT THE DATE AND NEAREST THE LOCATION OF "THE DOMAIN BASE" WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HIMALAYAS. THIS WAS THE IN THE AREA OF "MEHRGARH", AN EARLY BEGINNING OF THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY EXCAVATED.)


"(BOLAN PASS (URDU: درہ بولان) IS A MOUNTAIN PASS THROUGH THE TOBA KAKAR RANGE OF MOUNTAINS IN WESTERN PAKISTAN, 120 KILOMETERS FROM THE AFGHANISTAN BORDER. STRATEGICALLY LOCATED, TRADERS, INVADERS, AND NOMADIC TRIBES HAVE ALSO USED IT AS A GATEWAY TO AND FROM THE SOUTH ASIA.)


THE KHYBER PASS, (ALSO SPELLED KHAIBER OR KHAYBAR) (URDU: درہ خیبر) (ALTITUDE: 1,070 M, 3,510 FT) IS THE MOUNTAIN PASS THAT LINKS PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN. THROUGHOUT HISTORY IT HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT TRADE ROUTE BETWEEN CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTH ASIA AND A STRATEGIC MILITARY LOCATION.


"MEHRGARH IS NOW SEEN AS A PRECURSOR TO THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION. "DISCOVERIES AT MEHRGARH CHANGED THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF THE INDUS CIVILIZATION," ACCORDING TO AHMAD HASAN DANI, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF ARCHAEOLOGY AT QUAID-E-AZAM UNIVERSITY, ISLAMABAD, "THERE WE HAVE THE WHOLE SEQUENCE, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF SETTLED VILLAGE LIFE.


THE KACHI PLAIN AND IN THE BOLAN BASIN (ARE) SITUATED AT THE BOLAN PEAK PASS, ONE OF THE MAIN ROUTES CONNECTING SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN, EASTERN IRAN, THE BALOCHISTAN HILLS AND THE INDUS VALLEY. THIS AREA OF ROLLING HILLS IS THUS LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE INDUS VALLEY, WHERE, AROUND 2500 BC, A LARGE URBAN CIVILIZATION EMERGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THOSE OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN EMPIRE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT, A CONTINUOUS SEQUENCE OF DWELLING-SITES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FROM 7000 BC TO 500 BC. THE CHALCOLITHIC PEOPLE OF MEHRGARH ALSO HAD CONTACTS WITH CONTEMPORANEOUS CULTURES IN NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN, NORTHEASTERN IRAN AND SOUTHERN CENTRAL ASIA.


IN APRIL 2006, IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL NATURE THAT THE OLDEST (AND FIRST EARLY NEOLITHIC) EVIDENCE FOR THE DRILLING OF HUMAN TEETH IN VIVO (I.E. IN A LIVING PERSON) WAS FOUND IN MEHRGARH. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, THEIR DISCOVERIES POINT TO A TRADITION OF PROTO-DENTISTRY IN THE EARLY FARMING CULTURES OF THAT REGION. "HERE WE DESCRIBE ELEVEN DRILLED MOLAR CROWNS FROM NINE ADULTS DISCOVERED IN A NEOLITHIC GRAVEYARD IN PAKISTAN THAT DATES FROM 7,500 TO 9,000 YEARS AGO."

52 "... THEY REPORTED SIGHTING "VIMANAS" OR SPACE CRAFT IN THE AREA.."
"A VIMANA (SANSKRIT: FASRA) IS A MYTHICAL FLYING MACHINE, DESCRIBED IN THE SANSKRIT EPICS. THE PREDECESSORS OF THE FLYING VIMANAS OF THE SANSKRIT EPICS ARE THE FLYING CHARIOTS EMPLOYED BY VARIOUS GODS IN THE VEDAS.


THE FIRST FLYING VIMANA MENTIONED IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY:


"THE PUSHPAKA CHARIOT THAT RESEMBLES THE SUN AND BELONGS TO MY BROTHER WAS BROUGHT BY THE POWERFUL RAVANA; THAT AERIAL AND EXCELLENT CAR GOING EVERYWHERE AT WILL.... THAT CAR RESEMBLING A BRIGHT CLOUD IN THE SKY... AND THE KING [RAMA] GOT IN, AND THE EXCELLENT CAR AT THE COMMAND OF THE RAGHIRA, ROSE UP INTO THE HIGHER ATMOSPHERE.'


THE RIGVEDA DOES NOT MENTION VIMANAS, BUT VERSES RV1.164.47-48 HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS EVIDENCE FOR THE IDEA OF "MECHANICAL BIRDS":

"DARK THE DESCENT: THE BIRDS ARE GOLDEN-COLOURED; UP TO THE HEAVEN THEY FLY ROBED IN THE WATERS. AGAIN DESCEND THEY FROM THE SEAT OF ORDER, AND ALL THE EARTH IS MOISTENED WITH THEIR FATNESS."
"TWELVE ARE THE FELLIES, AND THE WHEEL IS SINGLE; THREE ARE THE NAVES. WHAT MAN HATH UNDERSTOOD IT?
THEREIN ARE SET TOGETHER SPOKES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY, WHICH IN NOWISE CAN BE LOOSENED." (TRANS. GRIFFITH)

IN DAYANANDA SARASWATI'S "TRANSLATION", THESE VERSES BECOME:

"JUMPING INTO SPACE SPEEDILY WITH A CRAFT USING FIRE AND WATER... CONTAINING TWELVE STAMGHAS (PILLARS), ONE WHEEL, THREE MACHINES, 300 PIVOTS, AND 60 INSTRUMENTS."

BUT LIKELIER IN THE ORIGINAL INDIAN SYMBOLISM WHEN THAT HYMN WAS COMPOSED, THE WHEEL IS A YEAR, THE 12 "FELLIES" ARE MONTHS (LUNATIONS), AND THE 360 SPOKES ARE DAYS.


IN THE RAMAYANA, THE PUSHPAKA ("FLOWERY") VIMANA OF RAVANA IS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:

"THE PUSHPAKA CHARIOT THAT RESEMBLES THE SUN AND BELONGS TO MY BROTHER WAS BROUGHT BY THE POWERFUL RAVANA; THAT AERIAL AND EXCELLENT CAR GOING EVERYWHERE AT WILL.... THAT CAR RESEMBLING A BRIGHT CLOUD IN THE SKY... AND THE KING [RAMA] GOT IN, AND THE EXCELLENT CAR AT THE COMMAND OF THE RAGHIRA, ROSE UP INTO THE HIGHER ATMOSPHERE."

IT IS THE FIRST FLYING VIMANA MENTIONED IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY (AS DISTINCT FROM THE GODS' FLYING HORSE-DRAWN CHARIOTS).
PUSHPAKA WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY MAYA FOR KUBERA, THE GOD OF WEALTH, BUT WAS LATER STOLEN, ALONG WITH LANKA, BY HIS HALF-BROTHER, THE DEMON KING RAVANA.


ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE ASURA MAYA HAD A VIMANA MEASURING TWELVE CUBITS IN CIRCUMFERENCE, WITH FOUR STRONG WHEELS. APART FROM 'BLAZING MISSILES', THE POEM RECORDS THE USE OF OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS. 'INDRA'S DART' (INDRAVAJRA) OPERATED VIA A CIRCULAR 'REFLECTOR1. WHEN SWITCHED ON, IT PRODUCED A 'SHAFT OF LIGHT' WHICH, WHEN FOCUSED ON ANY TARGET, IMMEDIATELY 'CONSUMED IT WITH ITS POWER'.


IN ONE EXCHANGE, THE HERO, KRISHNA, IS PURSUING HIS ENEMY, SALVA, IN THE SKY, WHEN SALVA'S VIMANA, THE SAUBHA, IS MADE INVISIBLE IN SOME WAY. UNDETERRED, KRISHNA IMMEDIATELY FIRES OFF A SPECIAL WEAPON: "I QUICKLY LAID ON AN ARROW, WHICH KILLED BY SEEKING OUT SOUND".


MANY OTHER TERRIBLE WEAPONS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MAHABHARATA, BUT THE MOST FEARSOME OF ALL IS THE ONE USED AGAINST THE VRISHIS. THE NARRATIVE RECORDS:

 

"GURKHA FLYING IN HIS SWIFT AND POWERFUL VIMANA HURLED AGAINST THE THREE CITIES OF THE VRISHNIS AND ANDHAKAS A SINGLE PROJECTILE CHARGED WITH ALL THE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE. AN INCANDESCENT COLUMN OF SMOKE AND FIRE, AS BRILLIANT AS TEN THOUSANDS SUNS, ROSE IN ALL ITS SPLENDOUR. IT WAS THE UNKNOWN WEAPON, THE IRON THUNDERBOLT, A GIGANTIC MESSENGER OF DEATH WHICH REDUCED TO ASHES THE ENTIRE RACE OF THE VRISHNIS AND ANDHAKAS."

"AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE (OBE), IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT TYPICALLY INVOLVES A SENSATION OF FLOATING OUTSIDE OF ONE'S BODY AND, IN SOME CASES, PERCEIVING ONE'S PHYSICAL BODY FROM A PLACE OUTSIDE ONE'S BODY (AUTOSCOPY). ABOUT ONE IN TEN PEOPLE HAS REPORTED HAVING AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES. IT IS CLAIMED THAT THOSE EXPERIENCING AN OBE SOMETIMES OBSERVE DETAILS WHICH WERE UNKNOWN TO THEM BEFOREHAND.
 

THE FIRST EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF OBES WAS MADE BY CELIA GREEN (1968). SHE COLLECTED WRITTEN, FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS FROM A TOTAL OF 400 SUBJECTS, RECRUITED BY MEANS OF APPEALS IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, AND FOLLOWED UP BY QUESTIONNAIRE. SOME 80% REPORTED FEELING THEY WERE A 'DISEMBODIED CONSCIOUSNESS', WITH NO EXTERNAL BODY AT ALL.


ANOTHER FORM OF A SPONTANEOUS OBE OCCURS DURING A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE (NDE). THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF AN NDE USUALLY INCLUDES PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND TRANSCENDENTAL FACTORS (PARNIA, WALLER, YEATES & FENWICK, 2001) SUCH AS IMPRESSIONS OF BEING OUTSIDE THE PHYSICAL BODY (AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE), TYPICALLY THE EXPERIENCE FOLLOWS A DISTINCT PROGRESSION, STARTING WITH THE SENSATION OF FLOATING ABOVE ONE'S BODY AND SEEING THE SURROUNDING AREA."

55 ..."THE SPACE CRAFT WAS STRUCK BY A BOLT OF LIGHTING"... "LIGHTNING IS AN ATMOSPHERIC DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS DURING THUNDERSTORMS, AND SOMETIMES DURING VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS OR DUST STORMS. THE LEADER OF A BOLT OF LIGHTNING CAN TRAVEL AT SPEEDS OF 60,000 M/S, AND CAN REACH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 30,000 °C (54,000 °F), HOT ENOUGH TO FUSE SOIL OR SAND INTO GLASS CHANNELS. THERE ARE OVER 16 MILLION LIGHTNING STORMS EVERY YEAR."

56 ..."ELECTRONIC WAVELENGTH"... "IN PHYSICS, WAVELENGTH IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN REPEATING UNITS OF A PROPAGATING WAVE OF A GIVEN FREQUENCY. IT IS COMMONLY DESIGNATED BY THE GREEK LETTER LAMBDA (Λ). EXAMPLES OF WAVE-LIKE PHENOMENA ARE LIGHT, WATER WAVES, AND SOUND WAVES. IN A WAVE, A PROPERTY VARIES WITH THE POSITION.

 

FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PROPERTY CAN BE THE AIR PRESSURE FOR A SOUND WAVE, OR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ELECTRIC OR THE MAGNETIC FIELD FOR LIGHT. THE WAVELENGTHS OF FREQUENCIES AUDIBLE TO THE HUMAN EAR (20 HZ–20 KHZ) ARE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 17 M AND 17 MM, RESPECTIVELY. VISIBLE LIGHT RANGES FROM DEEP RED, ROUGHLY 700 NM TO VIOLET, ROUGHLY 400 NM (430–750 THZ). FOR OTHER EXAMPLES, SEE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM."

57 ..."SPACE OPERA" CIVILIZATION"... "IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE 1920S THAT THE SPACE OPERA PROPER APPEARED IN THE PULP MAGAZINES WEIRD TALES AND AMAZING STORIES. UNLIKE EARLIER STORIES OF SPACE ADVENTURE, WHICH EITHER RELATED THE INVASION OF EARTH BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS, OR CONCENTRATED ON THE INVENTION OF A SPACE VEHICLE BY A GENIUS INVENTOR, PURE SPACE OPERA SIMPLY TOOK SPACE TRAVEL FOR GRANTED (USUALLY BY SETTING THE STORY IN THE FAR FUTURE), SKIPPED THE PRELIMINARIES, AND LAUNCHED STRAIGHT INTO TALES OF DERRING-DO AMONG THE STARS. THE FIRST STORIES OF THIS TYPE WERE J. SCHLOSSEL'S THE SECOND SWARM (SPRING 1928) IN AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY AND EDMOND HAMILTON'S CRASHING SUNS (AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1928) AND THE STAR STEALERS (FEBRUARY 1929) IN WEIRD TALES .

 

SIMILAR STORIES BY OTHER WRITERS FOLLOWED THROUGH 1929 AND 1930; BY 1931 THE SPACE OPERA WAS WELL-ESTABLISHED AS A DOMINANT SUB-GENRE OF SCIENCE FICTION. THE TRANSITION FROM THE OLDER SPACE-VOYAGE STORY TO THE SPACE OPERA CAN BE SEEN IN THE WORKS OF E. E. "DOC" SMITH. HIS FIRST PUBLISHED WORK, THE SKYLARK OF SPACE (AUGUST-OCTOBER 1928, AMAZING STORIES), MERGES THE TRADITIONAL TALE OF A SCIENTIST INVENTING A SPACE-DRIVE WITH PLANETARY ROMANCE IN THE STYLE OF EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS; BUT BY THE TIME OF THE SEQUEL, SKYLARK THREE (AUGUST-OCTOBER 1930, AMAZING STORIES) WHICH INTRODUCES THE SPACE FARING RACE OF THE FENACHRONE, SMITH HAD MOVED CLOSER TO A SPACE OPERA MODE.

 

SPACE OPERA IN ITS MOST FAMILIAR FORM WAS A PRODUCT OF 1930S-40S PULP MAGAZINES. LIKE EARLY SCIENCE FICTION IN GENERAL, SPACE OPERA BORROWED MUCH OF ITS STYLE FROM ESTABLISHED ADVENTURE, CRIME, AND THRILLER GENRES. NOTABLE INFLUENCES INCLUDED STORIES THAT DESCRIBED ADVENTURES ON EXOTIC OR UNCIVILIZED FRONTIERS, E.G. THE AMERICAN WEST, AFRICA, OR THE ORIENT.

 

THE IMAGINED FUTURE OF SPACE OPERA INCLUDED IMMENSE SPACE LINERS, INTREPID EXPLORERS OF UNKNOWN WORLDS, PIRATES OF THE SPACE WAYS, AND TOUGH BUT INCORRUPTIBLE SPACE POLICE.


E.E."DOC" SMITH'S LATER LENSMAN SERIES AND THE WORKS OF EDMOND HAMILTON, JOHN W. CAMPBELL, AND JACK WILLIAMSON IN THE 1930S AND 1940S WERE POPULAR WITH READERS AND MUCH IMITATED BY OTHER WRITERS. BY THE EARLY 1940S, THE REPETITIOUSNESS AND EXTRAVAGANCE OF SOME OF THESE STORIES LED TO OBJECTIONS FROM SOME FANS."

58 "...1493 AD -- "THE REQUIREMENT"...
"THE REQUIREMENT WAS PUBLISHED AS A PAPAL "BULL", ISSUED BY THE INFAMOUS POPE ALEXANDER VI, (RODRIGO BORGIA), ROMAN CATHOLIC POPE FROM 1492 UNTIL HIS DEATH, IS THE MOST MEMORABLE OF THE POPES OF THE RENAISSANCE.


BECAUSE OF THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AMERICAS IN 1493, THE KING OF SPAIN, HAD A SMALL TWINGE OF FEAR AT THE PROSPECT THAT GOD MIGHT BECOME ANGRY AT HIM FOR ALL THE MURDER, THEFT AND MAYHEM HE ENDORSED IN THE NEW WORLD. SO, HE PERSUADED POPE ALEXANDER VI TO SANCTION AN OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION INTENDED TO DISSOLVE THE STAIN OF BLOODY CULPABILITY FROM THE KING'S OWN IMMORTAL SOUL.

 

THIS DOCUMENT, CALLED "THE REQUIREMENT", WAS SUPPOSED TO BE READ, WHETHER TRANSLATED INTO THE NATIVE LANGUAGE OF THE INHABITANTS OR NOT, TO THE CITIZENS OF EVERY FOREIGN NATION JUST PRIOR TO THEIR CONQUEST. THE GIST OF THE PROCLAMATION WAS TO INFORM THE SOON TO BE VANQUISHED THAT THEIR LANDS WERE BEING "DONATED" TO SPAIN.
 

THE REQUIREMENT READ, IN PART:

"I, (NAME OF THE CONQUISTADOR), SERVANT OF THE HIGH AND MIGHTY KINGS OF CASTILE AND LEON, CONQUERORS OF BARBARIAN PEOPLES, AND BEING THEIR MESSENGER AND CAPTAIN, HEREBY NOTIFY AND INFORM YOU... THAT GOD OUR LORD, ONE AND ETERNAL, CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH AND A MAN AND A WOMAN FROM WHOM YOU AND I AND ALL THE MULTITUDE BEGOTTEN FROM THESE OVER THE PAST FIVE THOUSAND AND SOME YEARS SINCE THE WORLD WAS MADE ...

 

AND SO I REQUEST AND REQUIRE YOU... TO RECOGNIZE THE CHURCH AS YOUR MISTRESS AND AS GOVERNESS OF THE WORLD AND UNIVERSE, AND THE HIGH PRIEST, CALLED THE POPE, IN HER NAME, AND HIS MAJESTY (THE KING OF SPAIN) IN HER PLACE, AS RULER AND LORD KING ... AND IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS... WITH THE HELP OF GOD I SHALL COME MIGHTILY AGAINST YOU, AND I SHALL MAKE WAR ON YOU EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY WAY THAT I CAN, AND I SHALL SUBJECT YOU TO THE YOKE AND OBEDIENCE OF THE CHURCH AND HIS MAJESTY, AND I SHALL SEIZE YOUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND I SHALL MAKE THEM SLAVES, TO SELL AND DISPOSE OF AS HIS MAJESTY COMMANDS, AND I SHALL DO ALL THE EVIL AND DAMAGE TO YOU THAT I AM ABLE.

 

AND I INSIST THAT THE DEATHS AND DESTRUCTION THAT RESULT FROM THIS WILL BE YOUR FAULT."

ONE OF THE FIRST TO HEAR THE REQUIREMENT WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE MAYA, WHOSE SCALE OF TIME FOR THE CREATION OF LIFE ON EARTH DID NOT BEGIN A MERE 5,000 YEARS EARLIER, AS SUGGESTED BY THE POPE, RATHER THE MAYAN MEASURED ORIGINAL CREATION IN MILLIONS OF YEARS BY THE ASTRONOMICAL CALENDARS THEY KEPT, WHICH TRACKED THE SOLAR YEAR ACCURATELY TO WITHIN A FEW SECONDS A YEAR. THEIR COMMENT UPON HEARING THE REQUIREMENT WAS, "THE HOLY FATHER HAS INDEED BEEN GENEROUS WITH OTHERS' PROPERTY".


THE REQUIREMENT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS A RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS BY SPANISH CLERICS THAT THE WARS AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLES WERE UNJUST. COMPARING THEM TO SPAIN'S WARS AGAINST THE MOORS, THE CLERICS CLAIMED THAT MUSLIMS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST AND REJECTED HIM, SO THAT WAGING A CRUSADE AGAINST THEM WAS LEGITIMATE. IN CONTRAST, WARS AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICANS, WHO HAD NEVER COME INTO CONTACT WITH CHRISTIANITY WERE UNACCEPTABLE.

 

THE REQUIREMENT WAS INTENDED AS A LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO PLACE THE NATIVE POPULATION IN THE POSITION OF HAVING REJECTED CHRISTIANITY. IT STATED:

"WE PROTEST THAT ANY DEATHS THAT RESULT FROM THIS [REJECTION OF CHRISTIANITY] ARE YOUR FAULT..."

MANY CRITICS OF THE CONQUISTADORS' POLICIES WERE APPALLED BY THE FLIPPANT NATURE OF THE REQUIREMENT, AND THE PRIEST, BARTOLOMEO DE LAS CASAS, SAID IN RESPONSE TO IT THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO LAUGH OR TO CRY. WHILE THE CONQUISTADORS WERE ENCOURAGED TO USE AN INTERPRETER TO READ THE REQUIREMENT, THIS WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, AND IN MANY CASES, IT WAS READ OUT TO AN UNCOMPREHENDING POPULACE. IN SOME INSTANCES, IT WAS READ TO BARREN BEACHES AND EMPTY VILLAGES, LONG AFTER THE NATIVES HAD FLED, TO PRISONERS AFTER THEY WERE CAPTURED, OR EVEN FROM THE DECKS OF SHIPS ONCE THEY HAD JUST SPOTTED THE COAST.

 

NEVERTHELESS, FOR THE CONQUISTADORS, IT PROVIDED A RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR ATTACKING AND ENSLAVING THE NATIVE POPULATION, AND BECAUSE OF ITS POTENTIAL TO ENRICH THE COFFERS OF SPAIN, THE REQUIREMENT WAS NOT GENERALLY QUESTIONED."
-- REFERENCE: WIKIPEDIA.ORG


THE NET RESULT OF THE "DISCOVERY"" OF THE "NEW WORLD" WHICH WASN'T REALLY "NEW" AS IT HAD BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS ANY OTHER CONTINENT, AND HAD A LARGER POPULATION THAN EUROPE, WAS AS FOLLOWS:

1) HUNDREDS OF INDIGENOUS CULTURES WERE ERADICATED

2) APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY DISEASE AND WAR BROUGHT UPON THEM BY "ALIENS"

3) 100 MILLION PEOPLE FROM THE GOLD COAST OF AFRICA WERE ENSLAVED, AND/ OR MURDERED BY EUROPEANS IN AN EFFORT TO REPLACE THE "LABOR FORCE" OF SLAUGHTERED INDIGENOUS POPULATION OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE

4) NEARLY ALL OF THE PRICELESS LITERATURE, HISTORY, CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC ARTIFACTS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE WERE DESTROYED

5) MOST OF THE GOLD AND GEMS MINED OVER A PERIOD OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE STOLEN AND SHIPPED OFF THE A HANDFUL OF GREEDY, IDIOTIC, UNEDUCATED, FILTHY, DISEASE-RIDDEN, SUPERSTITIOUS, MURDEROUS, THIEVES IN EUROPE WHO SQUANDERED IT ON MINDLESS SELF-INDULGENCES.

59 "... THEY ARE INTERESTED PRIMARILY IN THE "LOW GRAVITY" SATELLITES IN THIS SPACE STATION WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...".
"ACCORDING TO THE NASA ASTRONAUT NEIL ARMSTRONG THE ALIENS HAVE A BASE ON THE MOON AND (THE ALIENS) TOLD US IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS TO GET OFF AND STAY OFF THE MOON!


SOUND FAR FETCHED? MILTON COOPER, A NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER TELLS US THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE ALIEN MOON BASE EXIST BUT THE U.S. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REFERS TO THE ALIEN MOON BASE AS "LUNA," THAT THERE IS A HUGE MINING OPERATION GOING ON THERE, AND THAT IS WHERE THE ALIENS KEEP THEIR HUGE MOTHER SHIPS WHILE THE TRIPS TO EARTH ARE MADE IN SMALLER "FLYING SAUCERS".

LUNA: THE ALIEN BASE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON. IT WAS SEEN AND FILMED BY THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS. A BASE, A MINING OPERATION USING VERY LARGE MACHINES, AND THE VERY LARGE ALIEN CRAFT DESCRIBED IN SIGHTING REPORTS AS MOTHER SHIPS EXIST THERE.

-MILTON COOPER

DID APOLLO 11 ENCOUNTER UFOS ON THE MOON? FROM THE BOOK "ABOVE TOP SECRET" BY TIMOTHY GOOD.


ACCORDING TO HITHERTO UNCONFIRMED REPORTS, BOTH NEIL ARMSTRONG AND EDWIN "BUZZ" ALDRIN SAW UFOS SHORTLY AFTER THEIR HISTORIC LANDING ON THE MOON IN APOLLO 11 ON 21 JULY 1969. I REMEMBER HEARING ONE OF THE ASTRONAUTS REFER TO A "LIGHT" IN OR ON A CARTER DURING THE TELEVISION TRANSMISSION, FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FROM MISSION CONTROL FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD.


ACCORDING TO A FORMER NASA EMPLOYEE OTTO BINDER, UNNAMED RADIO HAMS WITH THEIR OWN VHF RECEIVING FACILITIES THAT BYPASSED NASA'S BROADCASTING OUTLETS PICKED UP THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE:

NASA: WHAT'S THERE? MISSION CONTROL CALLING APOLLO 11...
APOLLO: THESE "BABIES" ARE HUGE, SIR! ENORMOUS! OH MY GOD! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT! I'M TELLING YOU THERE ARE OTHER SPACECRAFT OUT THERE, LINED UP ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CRATER EDGE! THEY'RE ON THE MOON WATCHING US!

IN 1979, MAURICE CHATELAIN, FORMER CHIEF OF NASA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS CONFIRMED THAT ARMSTRONG HAD INDEED REPORTED SEEING TWO UFOS ON THE RIM OF A CRATER.

"THE ENCOUNTER WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN NASA," HE REVEALED, "BUT NOBODY HAS TALKED ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW."

SOVIET SCIENTISTS WERE ALLEGEDLY THE FIRST TO CONFIRM THE INCIDENT. "ACCORDING TO OUR INFORMATION, THE ENCOUNTER WAS REPORTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LANDING OF THE MODULE," SAID DR. VLADIMIR AZHAZHA, A PHYSICIST AND PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AT MOSCOW UNIVERSITY. "NEIL ARMSTRONG RELAYED THE MESSAGE TO MISSION CONTROL THAT TWO LARGE, MYSTERIOUS OBJECTS WERE WATCHING THEM AFTER HAVING LANDED NEAR THE MOON MODULE. BUT HIS MESSAGE WAS NEVER HEARD BY THE PUBLIC-BECAUSE NASA CENSORED IT. "


ACCORDING TO ANOTHER SOVIET SCIENTIST, DR. ALEKSANDR KAZANTSEV, BUZZ ALDRIN TOOK COLOR MOVIE FILM OF THE UFOS FROM INSIDE THE MODULE, AND CONTINUED FILMING THEM AFTER HE AND ARMSTRONG WENT OUTSIDE. DR. AZHAZHA CLAIMS THAT THE UFOS DEPARTED MINUTES AFTER THE ASTRONAUTS CAME OUT ON TO THE LUNAR SURFACE.


MAURICE CHATELAIN ALSO CONFIRMED THAT APOLLO 11'S RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE INTERRUPTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN ORDER TO HIDE THE NEWS FROM THE PUBLIC. BEFORE DISMISSING CHATELAIN'S SENSATIONAL CLAIMS, IT IS WORTH NOTING HIS IMPRESSIVE BACKGROUND IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND SPACE PROGRAM. HIS FIRST JOB AFTER MOVING FROM FRANCE WAS AS AN ELECTRONICS ENGINEER WITH CONVAIR, SPECIALIZING IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TELEMETRY, AND RADAR. IN 1959 HE WAS IN CHARGE OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC RESEARCH GROUP, DEVELOPING NEW RADAR AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FOR RYAN. ONE OF HIS ELEVEN PATENTS WAS AN AUTOMATIC FLIGHTS TO THE MOON. LATER, AT NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION, CHATELAIN WAS OFFERED THE JOB OF DESIGNING AND BUILDING THE APOLLO COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA-PROCESSING SYSTEMS.


CHATELAIN CLAIMS THAT,

"ALL APOLLO AND GEMINI FLIGHTS WERE FOLLOWED, BOTH AT A DISTANCE AND SOMETIMES ALSO QUITE CLOSELY, BY SPACE VEHICLES OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN-FLYING SAUCERS, OR UFOS, IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM BY THAT NAME. EVERY TIME IT OCCURRED, THE ASTRONAUTS INFORMED MISSION CONTROL, WHO THEN ORDERED ABSOLUTE SILENCE."

HE GOES ON TO SAY:

"I THINK THAT WALTER SCHIRRA ABOARD MERCURY 8 WAS THE FIRST OF THE ASTRONAUTS TO USE THE CODE NAME 'SANTA CLAUS' TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF FLYING SAUCERS NEXT TO SPACE CAPSULES. HOWEVER, HIS ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE BARELY NOTICED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN JAMES LOVELL ON BOARD THE APOLLO 8 COMMAND MODULE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE MOON AND SAID FOR EVERYBODY TO HEAR:

'PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.'

EVEN THOUGH THIS HAPPENED ON CHRISTMAS DAY 1968, MANY PEOPLE SENSED A HIDDEN MEANING IN THOSE WORDS."

RUMORS PERSIST. NASA MAY WELL BE A CIVILIAN AGENCY, BUT MANY OF ITS PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED BY THE DEFENSE BUDGET AND MOST OF THE ASTRONAUTS ARE SUBJECT TO MILITARY SECURITY REGULATIONS. APART FROM THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SCREENS ALL FILMS AND PROBABLY RADIO COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL. WE HAVE THE STATEMENTS BY OTTO BINDER, DR. GARRY HENDERSON AND MAURICE CHATELAIN THAT THE ASTRONAUTS WERE UNDER STRICT ORDERS NOT TO DISCUSS THEIR SIGHTINGS. AND GORDON COOPER HAS TESTIFIED TO A UNITED NATIONS COMMITTEE THAT ONE OF THE ASTRONAUTS ACTUALLY WITNESSED A UFO ON THE GROUND. IF THERE IS NO SECRECY, WHY HAS THIS SIGHTING NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC?


A CERTAIN PROFESSOR, WHO WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, WAS ENGAGED IN A DISCUSSION WITH NEIL ARMSTRONG DURING A NASA SYMPOSIUM.

PROFESSOR: WHAT REALLY HAPPENED OUT THERE WITH APOLLO 11?
ARMSTRONG: IT WAS INCREDIBLE, OF COURSE WE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY, THE FACT IS, WE WERE WARNED OFF! (BY THE ALIENS). THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION THEN OF A SPACE STATION OR A MOON CITY.
PROFESSOR: HOW DO YOU MEAN "WARNED OFF"?
ARMSTRONG: I CAN'T GO INTO DETAILS, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THEIR SHIPS WERE FAR SUPERIOR TO OURS BOTH IN SIZE AND TECHNOLOGY - BOY, WERE THEY BIG!... AND MENACING! NO, THERE IS NO QUESTION OF A SPACE STATION.
PROFESSOR: BUT NASA HAD OTHER MISSIONS AFTER APOLLO 11?
ARMSTRONG: NATURALLY-NASA WAS COMMITTED AT THAT TIME, AND COULDN'T RISK PANIC ON EARTH. BUT IT REALLY WAS A QUICK SCOOP AND BACK AGAIN.

ARMSTRONG CONFIRMED THAT THE STORY WAS TRUE BUT REFUSED TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL, BEYOND ADMITTING THAT THE CIA WAS BEHIND THE COVER-UP.
REASONABLE ACTIVITY OF AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION SHOWED UP UNEXPECTEDLY CLOSE TO US. WE WERE NOT READY FOR IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY


WE STILL CAN COME ACROSS PUBLICATIONS TRYING TO FIND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? AT THE SAME TIME, PRESENCE OF REASONABLE CREATURES HAS BEEN DETECTED JUST CLOSE TO OUR HOME, IN THE MOON. HOWEVER, THE DISCOVERY WAS IMMEDIATELY CLASSIFIED AS SECRET, AS IT WAS SO MUCH INCREDIBLE THAT EVEN COULD SHAKE THE ALREADY EXISTING SOCIAL PRINCIPLES, REPORTS RUSSIA'S NEWSPAPER "VECHERNY VOLGOGRAD."


HERE IS AN EXTRACT FROM THE OFFICIAL PRESS-RELEASE:

"NASA SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS PARTICIPATING IN EXPLORATION OF MARS AND MOON REPORTED RESULTS OF THEIR DISCOVERIES AT A BRIEFING AT THE WASHINGTON NATIONAL PRESS CLUB ON MARCH 21, 1996. IT WAS ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT MAN-CAUSED STRUCTURES AND OBJECTS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE MOON."

THE SCIENTISTS SPOKE RATHER CAUTIOUSLY AND EVASIVELY ABOUT THE FUNCTIONING OBJECTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UFO. THEY ALWAYS MENTIONED THE MAN-CAUSED OBJECTS AS POSSIBLE, AND POINTED OUT THE INFORMATION WAS STILL UNDER STUDY, AND OFFICIAL RESULTS WOULD BE PUBLISHED LATER.


IT WAS MENTIONED AT THE BRIEFING AS WELL THAT THE SOVIET UNION USED TO OWN SOME PHOTO MATERIALS PROVING PRESENCE OF REASONABLE ACTIVITY ON THE MOON. AND ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T IDENTIFIED WHAT KIND OF REASONABLE ACTIVITY IT WAS, THOUSANDS OF PHOTO-AND VIDEO MATERIALS PHOTOGRAPHED FROM THE APOLLO AND THE CLEMENTINE SPACE STATION DEMONSTRATED MANY PARTS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE WHERE THE ACTIVITY AND ITS TRACES WERE PERFECTLY EVIDENT. THE VIDEO FILMS AND PHOTOS MADE BY U.S. ASTRONAUTS DURING THE APOLLO PROGRAM WERE DEMONSTRATED AT THE BRIEFING.

 

AND PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY SURPRISED WHY THE MATERIALS HADN'T BEEN PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EARLIER. AND NASA SPECIALISTS ANSWERED:

"IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE REACTION OF PEOPLE TO THE INFORMATION THAT SOME CREATURES HAD BEEN OR STILL WERE ON THE MOON. BESIDES, THERE WERE SOME OTHER REASONS TO IT, WHICH WERE BEYOND NASA."

SPECIALIST FOR LUNAR ARTIFACTS RICHARD HOAGLAND SAYS THAT NASA IS STILL TRYING TO VEIL PHOTO MATERIALS BEFORE THEY ARE PUBLISHED IN PUBLIC CATALOGUES AND FILES, THEY DO RETOUCHING OR PARTIALLY REFOCUS THEM WHILE COPYING. SOME INVESTIGATORS, HOAGLAND IS AMONG THEM, SUPPOSE THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL RACE HAD USED THE MOON AS A TERMINAL STATION DURING THEIR ACTIVITY ON THE EARTH. THE SUGGESTIONS ARE CONFIRMED BY THE LEGENDS AND MYTHS INVENTED BY DIFFERENT NATIONS OF OUR PLANET.


RUINS OF LUNAR CITIES STRETCHED ALONG MANY KILOMETERS, HUGE TRANSPARENT DOMES ON MASSIVE BASEMENTS, NUMEROUS TUNNELS AND OTHER CONSTRUCTIONS MAKE SCIENTISTS RECONSIDER THEIR OPINIONS CONCERNING THE LUNAR PROBLEMS. HOW THE MOON APPEARED AND PRINCIPLES OF ITS REVOLVING AROUND THE EARTH STILL POSE A GREAT PROBLEM FOR SCIENTISTS.


SOME PARTIALLY DESTROYED OBJECTS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE CAN'T BE PLACED AMONG NATURAL GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS, AS THEY ARE OF COMPLEX ORGANIZATION AND GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE. IN THE UPPER PART OF RIMA HADLEY, NOT FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE APOLLO-15 HAD LANDED, A CONSTRUCTION SURROUNDED WITH A TALL D-SHAPED WALL WAS DISCOVERED. AS OF NOW, DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN 44 REGIONS.


THE NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER, THE HOUSTON PLANETARY INSTITUTE AND SPECIALISTS FROM THE BANK OF SPACE INFORMATION ARE INVESTIGATING THE REGIONS. MYSTERIOUS TERRACE-SHAPED EXCAVATIONS OF THE ROCK HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED NEAR THE TIHO CRATER. THE CONCENTRIC HEXAHEDRAL EXCAVATIONS AND THE TUNNEL ENTRY AT THE TERRACE SIDE CANT BE RESULTS OF NATURAL GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES; INSTEAD, THEY LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE OPEN CAST MINES.
 

A TRANSPARENT DOME RAISED ABOVE THE CRATER EDGE WAS DISCOVERED NEAR THE CRATER COPERNICUS. THE DOME IS UNUSUAL AS IT IS GLOWING WHITE AND BLUE FROM INSIDE. A RATHER UNUSUAL OBJECT, WHICH IS UNUSUAL INDEED EVEN FOR THE MOON, WAS DISCOVERED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE FACTORY AREA. A DISK OF ABOUT 50 METERS IN DIAMETER STANDS ON A SQUARE BASEMENT SURROUNDED WITH RHOMBI WALLS. IN THE PICTURE, CLOSE TO THE RHOMBI, WE CAN ALSO SEE A DARK ROUND EMBRASURE IN THE GROUND, WHICH RESEMBLES AN ENTRY IN AN UNDERGROUND CAPONIER. THERE IS A REGULAR RECTANGULAR AREA BETWEEN FACTORY AND THE CRATER COPERNICUS WHICH IS 300 METERS WIDE 400 METERS LONG.

APOLLO 10 ASTRONAUTS MADE A UNIQUE PICTURE (AS10-32-4822) OF A ONE-MILE LONG OBJECT CALLED CASTLE, WHICH IS HANGING AT THE HEIGHT OF 14 KILOMETERS AND CASTS A DISTINCT SHADOW ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. THE OBJECT SEEMS TO BE CONSISTING OF SEVERAL CYLINDRICAL UNITS AND A LARGE CONJUNCTIVE UNIT. INTERNAL POROUS STRUCTURE OF THE CASTLE IS CLEARLY SEEN IN ONE OF THE PICTURES, WHICH MAKES AN IMPRESSION THAT SOME PARTS OF THE OBJECT ARE TRANSPARENT.

 

AS IT TURNED OUT AT THE BRIEFING WHERE MANY NASA SCIENTISTS WERE PRESENT, WHEN RICHARD HOAGLAND HAD REQUESTED ORIGINALS OF THE CASTLE PICTURES FOR THE SECOND TIME, NO PICTURES WERE FOUND THERE AT ALL. THEY DISAPPEARED EVEN FROM THE LIST OF PICTURES MADE BY THE APOLLO 10 CREW. ONLY INTERMEDIATE PICTURES OF THE OBJECT WERE FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DON'T DEPICT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE OBJECT. WHEN APOLLO-12 CREW LANDED ON THE LUNAR SURFACE, THEY SAW THAT THE LANDING WAS OBSERVED BY A HALF-TRANSPARENT PYRAMIDAL OBJECT.

 

IT WAS HANGING JUST SEVERAL METERS ABOVE THE LUNAR SURFACE AND SHIMMERED WITH ALL RAINBOW COLORS AGAINST THE BLACK SKY. IN 1969, WHEN THE FILM ABOUT ASTRONAUTS TRAVELING TO THE SEA OF STORMS WAS DEMONSTRATED (THE ASTRONAUTS SAW THE STRANGE OBJECTS ONCE AGAIN, WHICH WERE LATER CALLED “STRIPED GLASSES”), NASA FINALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT CONSEQUENCES SUCH KIND OF CONTROL COULD BRING.

 

ASTRONAUT MITCHELL ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT HIS FEELINGS AFTER A SUCCESSFUL RETURN THE FOLLOWING:

“MY NECK STILL ACHES AS I HAD TO CONSTANTLY TURN MY HEAD AROUND BECAUSE WE FELT WE WERE NOT ALONE THERE. WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT PRAY.”

JOHNSTON, WHO WORKED AT THE HOUSTON SPACE CENTER AND STUDIED PHOTOS AND VIDEO MATERIALS DONE DURING THE APOLLO PROGRAM, DISCUSSED THE ARTIFACTS WITH RICHARD HOAGLAND AND SAID, THE NASA LEADERSHIP WAS AWFULLY ANNOYED WITH THE GREAT NUMBER OF ANOMALOUS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, OBJECTS ON THE MOON. IT WAS EVEN SAID THAT PILOTED FLIGHTS TO THE MOON COULD BE BANNED IN THE PROGRAMS NETWORK. INVESTIGATORS ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN ANCIENT STRUCTURES RESEMBLING PARTIALLY DESTROYED CITIES.

 

THE ORBITAL SHOOTING REVEALS AN ASTONISHINGLY REGULAR GEOMETRY OF SQUARE AND RECTANGULAR CONSTRUCTIONS. THEY RESEMBLE OUR TERRESTRIAL CITIES SEEN FROM THE HEIGHT OF 5-8 KILOMETERS. A MISSION CONTROL SPECIALIST COMMENTED ON THE PICTURES: “OUR GUYS OBSERVED RUINS OF THE LUNAR CITIES, TRANSPARENT PYRAMIDS, DOMES AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY HIDDEN DEEP INSIDE THE NASA SAFES, AND FELT LIKE ROBINSON CRUSOE WHEN HE SUDDENLY CAME ACROSS PRINTS OF HUMAN BARE FEET ON THE SAND OF THE DESERT ISLAND.” WHAT DO GEOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS SAY AFTER STUDYING THE PICTURES OF LUNAR CITIES AND OTHER ANOMALOUS OBJECTS?

 

THEY SAY, SUCH OBJECTS CAN'T BE NATURAL FORMATIONS. “WE SHOULD ADMIT THEY ARE ARTIFICIAL, ESPECIALLY THE DOMES AND PYRAMIDS.” REASONABLE ACTIVITY OF AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION SHOWED UP UNEXPECTEDLY CLOSE TO US. WE WERE NOT READY FOR IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY, AND SOME PEOPLE HARDLY BELIEVE THEY ARE TRUE EVEN NOW."

60 "... SYNTHESIZED FROM GYPSUM..."

"GYPSUM IS A COMMON MINERAL, WITH THICK AND EXTENSIVE EVAPORITE BEDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. DEPOSITS ARE KNOWN TO OCCUR IN STRATA FROM AS EARLY AS THE PERMIAN AGE. GYPSUM IS DEPOSITED IN LAKE AND SEA WATER, AS WELL AS IN HOT SPRINGS, FROM VOLCANIC VAPORS, AND SULFATE SOLUTIONS IN VEINS. HYDROTHERMAL ANHYDRITE IN VEINS IS COMMONLY HYDRATED TO GYPSUM BY GROUNDWATER IN NEAR SURFACE EXPOSURES. IT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE MINERALS HALITE AND SULFUR.


THE WORD GYPSUM IS DERIVED FROM THE AORIST FORM OF THE GREEK VERB JAYEIPEUIO, 'TO COOK", REFERRING TO THE BURNT OR CALCINED MINERAL. BECAUSE THE GYPSUM FROM THE QUARRIES OF THE MONTMARTRE DISTRICT OF PARIS HAS LONG FURNISHED BURNT GYPSUM USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, THIS MATERIAL HAS BEEN CALLED PLASTER OF PARIS. IT IS ALSO USED IN FOOT CREAMS, SHAMPOOS AND MANY OTHER HAIR PRODUCTS.


BECAUSE GYPSUM DISSOLVES OVER TIME IN WATER, GYPSUM IS RARELY FOUND IN THE FORM OF SAND. HOWEVER, THE UNIQUE CONDITIONS OF THE WHITE SANDS NATIONAL MONUMENT IN THE US STATE OF NEW MEXICO HAVE CREATED A 710 KM2 (275 SQ MILE) EXPANSE OF WHITE GYPSUM SAND, ENOUGH TO SUPPLY THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WITH DRYWALL FOR 1,000 YEARS."

CHAPTER SIX - MY EDUCATION BEGINS
 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"BY THE 15TH DAY AFTER "RESCUING" AIRL FROM THE CRASH SITE, I WAS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE FLUIDLY AND EFFORTLESSLY WITH HER IN ENGLISH. SHE HAD ABSORBED SO MUCH WRITTEN MATERIAL BY THIS TIME THAT HER ACADEMIC EDUCATION FAR EXCEEDED MY OWN. ALTHOUGH I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES IN 1940 AND ATTENDED COLLEGE FOR FOUR YEARS OF PREMEDICAL AND NURSING TRAINING, THE VARIETY OF MY OWN READING HAD BEEN FAIRLY LIMITED.


I HAD NOT STUDIED MOST OF THE SUBJECTS TO WHICH AIRL HAD NOW BEEN EXPOSED, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HER ACUTE UNDERSTANDING, VERY INTENSE STUDY HABITS AND A NEARLY PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY! SHE WAS ABLE TO RECALL LONG PASSAGES FROM BOOKS SHE READ. SHE WAS ESPECIALLY FOND OF SECTIONS OF HER FAVORITE STORIES FROM CLASSIC LITERATURE LIKE THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN 46 (FOOTNOTE), TALES FROM GULLIVER'S TRAVELS 47 (FOOTNOTE) AND PETER PAN 48 (FOOTNOTE) AND THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW 49 (FOOTNOTE).


BY THIS TIME AIRL HAD BECOME THE TEACHER, AND I WAS THE STUDENT. I WAS ABOUT TO LEARN WHAT MEN OF EARTH DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING!
THE THRONG OF SCIENTISTS AND AGENTS WHO OBSERVED US THROUGH THE ONE-WAY GLASS OF OUR INTERVIEW ROOM, WHOM AIRL AND I NOW REFERRED TO AS "THE GALLERY", WERE GROWING INCREASINGLY IMPATIENT TO ASK HER QUESTIONS. BUT AIRL CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO ALLOW ANY QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED OF HER BY ANYONE OTHER THAN MYSELF, EVEN VICARIOUSLY THROUGH ME AS AN INTERPRETER, OR IN WRITING.


ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 16TH DAY AIRL AND I SAT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AS SHE READ. SHE CLOSED THE LAST PAGE OF A BOOK SHE WAS READING AND PLACED IT ASIDE. I WAS ABOUT TO HAND HER THE NEXT BOOK FROM A LARGE PILE WAITING TO BE READ, WHEN SHE TURNED AND SAID OR "THOUGHT" TO ME, "I AM READY TO SPEAK NOW". AT FIRST I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE REMARK. I GESTURED FOR HER TO CONTINUE AND SHE BEGAN TO TEACH ME MY FIRST LESSON."

 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)
TOP SECRET
OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD, 50 9TH BOMB GROUP

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 24. 7. 1947, 1ST SESSION


"WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY, AIRL?", I ASKED.


"I HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE IN THIS SECTOR OF SPACE FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS. HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY HAD INTIMATE CONTACT WITH BEINGS ON EARTH SINCE 5,965 BCE. IT IS NOT MY PRIMARY FUNCTION TO INTERACT WITH INHABITANTS OF PLANETS WITHIN THE DOMAIN. I AM AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER, WITH MANY DUTIES TO PERFORM. NONETHELESS, ALTHOUGH I AM FLUENT IN 347 OTHER LANGUAGES WITHIN THE DOMAIN, I HAVE NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO YOUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE.


THE LAST EARTH LANGUAGE WITH WHICH I WAS CONVERSANT WAS THE SANSKRIT LANGUAGE OF THE VEDIC HYMNS. 50 (FOOTNOTE) AT THAT TIME I WAS A MEMBER OF A MISSION SENT TO INVESTIGATE THE LOSS OF A DOMAIN BASE LOCATED IN THE HIMALAYA MOUNTAINS. AN ENTIRE BATTALION OF OFFICERS, PILOTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL DISAPPEARED AND THE BASE DESTROYED.


SEVERAL MILLION YEARS AGO I WAS TRAINED AND SERVED AS AN INVESTIGATION, DATA EVALUATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT OFFICER FOR THE DOMAIN. BECAUSE I WAS EXPERIENCED IN THAT TECHNOLOGY, I WAS SENT TO EARTH AS PART OF THE SEARCH TEAM. ONE OF MY DUTIES INVOLVED INTERROGATION OF THE HUMAN POPULATION THAT INHABITED THE ADJOINING AREA AT THAT TIME. 51 (FOOTNOTE) MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THAT REGION REPORTED SIGHTING "VIMANAS" OR SPACE CRAFT IN THE AREA. 52 (FOOTNOTE)


FOLLOWING THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF EVIDENCE, TESTIMONY, OBSERVATION, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE, I LED MY TEAM TO THE DISCOVERY THAT THERE WERE STILL "OLD EMPIRE" SHIPS AND WELL-HIDDEN "OLD EMPIRE" INSTALLATIONS IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY UNAWARE.


YOU AND I WERE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN YOUR LANGUAGE BECAUSE I, PERSONALLY, HAVE NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO YOUR LANGUAGE. HOWEVER, NOW THAT I HAVE SCANNED THE BOOKS AND MATERIAL YOU PROVIDED ME THIS DATA HAS BEEN RELAYED TO OUR SPACE STATION IN THIS REGION AND PROCESSED BY OUR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER THROUGH OUR COMPUTERS. IT HAS BEEN TRANSLATED INTO MY OWN LANGUAGE AND RELAYED BACK TO ME IN A CONTEXT THAT I CAN THINK WITH. I HAVE ALSO RECEIVED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE FILES STORED IN OUR COMPUTERS ABOUT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND DOMAIN RECORDS CONCERNING EARTH CIVILIZATION." 53 (FOOTNOTE)


"NOW I AM PREPARED TO GIVE YOU CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT I FEEL WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE TO YOU. I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH. ALTHOUGH TRUTH IS RELATIVE TO ALL OTHER TRUTH, I WISH TO SHARE WITH YOU AS HONESTLY AND ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE, TRUTH AS I SEE IT, WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF MY INTEGRITY TO MYSELF, TO MY RACE AND WITHOUT VIOLATING MY OBLIGATIONS TO THE ORGANIZATION I SERVE AND HAVE SWORN TO UPHOLD AND PROTECT".


"OK", I THOUGHT. "WILL YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE GALLERY NOW?"


"NO. I WILL NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS. I WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO YOU THAT I THINK WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS WHO COMPRISE HUMANITY, AND THAT WILL FOSTER THE SURVIVAL OF ALL THE MYRIAD LIFE FORMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF EARTH, AS IT IS A PART OF MY MISSION TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF EARTH.


"PERSONALLY, IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT ALL SENTIENT BEINGS ARE IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS. THIS INCLUDES HUMAN BEINGS. FOR THE SAKE OF ACCURACY AND SIMPLICITY I WILL USE A MADE-UP WORD: "IS-BE". BECAUSE THE PRIMARY NATURE OF AN IMMORTAL BEING IS THAT THEY LIVE IN A TIMELESS STATE OF "IS", AND THE ONLY REASON FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IS THAT THEY DECIDE TO "BE".


NO MATTER HOW LOWLY THEIR STATION IN A SOCIETY, EVERY IS-BE DESERVES THE RESPECT AND TREATMENT THAT I MYSELF WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE FROM OTHERS. EACH PERSON ON EARTH CONTINUES TO BE AN IS-BE WHETHER THEY ARE AWARE OF THE FACT OR NOT."


(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
(I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS CONVERSATION. HER TONE WAS VERY MATTER-OF-FACT AND EMOTIONLESS. HOWEVER, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SENSED THE PRESENCE OF A WARM AND REAL "PERSONALITY" IN AIRL. HER REFERENCE TO "IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEINGS" STRUCK ME LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHT IN A DARK ROOM. I HAD NEVER BEFORE CONSIDERED THAT A HUMAN BEING COULD BE AN IMMORTAL BEING.


I THOUGHT THAT STATUS OR POWER WAS RESERVED SOLELY FOR THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST. AND, BECAUSE I AM A DEVOUT CATHOLIC AND SUBJECT TO THE WORD JESUS, AND THE HOLY FATHER, I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF A WOMAN AS AN IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEING EITHER - NOT EVEN THE HOLY MOTHER MARY. YET, WHEN AIRL THOUGHT THAT THOUGHT, I BECAME VIVIDLY AWARE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT SHE, PERSONALLY, WAS AN IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEING, AND SO ARE WE ALL!


AIRL SAID THAT SHE SENSED THAT I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE IDEA. SHE SAID SHE WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO ME THAT I AM ALSO AN IMMORTAL SPIRITUAL BEING. SHE SAID, "BE ABOVE YOUR BODY!" IMMEDIATELY, I REALIZED THAT I WAS "OUTSIDE" OF MY BODY, LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CEILING AT THE TOP OF MY BODY'S HEAD! 54 (FOOTNOTE) I WAS ALSO ABLE TO SEE THE ROOM AROUND ME, INCLUDING AIRL'S BODY SITTING IN THE CHAIR NEXT TO MY OWN BODY. AFTER A MOMENT, I REALIZED THE SIMPLE, BUT SHOCKING, REALITY, THAT "I" AM NOT A BODY.


IN THAT MOMENT A BLACK VEIL LIFTED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, AND FOR A VERY LONG TIME INTO THE PAST, I REALIZED THAT I AM NOT "MY SOUL", BUT THAT "I" AM "ME" A SPIRITUAL BEING. THIS WAS AN UNEXPLAINABLE EPIPHANY, BUT ONE THAT FILLS ME WITH A JOY AND RELIEF I CANNOT RECALL HAVING EXPERIENCED EVER BEFORE. AS FOR THE "IMMORTAL" PART, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HER MEANING, AS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TAUGHT THAT I AM NOT IMMORTAL - A SPIRIT, PERHAPS - BUT CERTAINLY NOT IMMORTAL!


AFTER A MOMENT - I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG - AIRL ASKED ME IF I HAD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IDEA. SUDDENLY, I WAS BACK INSIDE MY BODY AGAIN, AND SAID OUT LOUD, "YES! I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN!".


I WAS SO TAKEN ABACK BY THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD TO GET UP FROM MY CHAIR AND WALK AROUND THE ROOM FOR A FEW MINUTES. I MADE AN EXCUSE THAT I NEEDED TO GET A DRINK OF WATER, AND GO TO THE RESTROOM, WHICH I DID. IN THE RESTROOM I LOOKED AT MY "SELF" IN THE MIRROR. I USED THE TOILET, REFRESHED MY MAKE-UP, AND STRAIGHTENED MY UNIFORM. AFTER 10 OR 15 MINUTES I FELT MORE "NORMAL" AGAIN AND RETURNED TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM.


AFTER THAT I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS NO LONGER JUST AN INTERPRETER FOR AIRL. I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS A "KINDRED SPIRIT". I FELT LIKE I WAS SAFE, AT HOME, WITH A TRUSTED FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER, AS CLOSE AS ANY I HAVE EVER HAD. AIRL SENSED AND UNDERSTOOD MY CONFUSION ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF "PERSONAL IMMORTALITY".

 

SHE BEGAN HER FIRST "LESSON" WITH ME BY EXPLAINING THIS TO ME."

 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW CONTINUED)


"AIRL TOLD ME HER REASONS FOR COMING TO EARTH AND FOR BEING IN THE AREA OF THE 509TH BOMBER SQUADRON. SHE WAS SENT BY HER SUPERIOR OFFICERS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPLOSIONS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH HAVE BEEN TESTED IN NEW MEXICO. HER SUPERIORS ORDERED HER TO GATHER INFORMATION FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THAT COULD BE USED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF RADIATION AND POTENTIAL HARM THIS MIGHT CAUSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. DURING HER MISSION, THE SPACE CRAFT WAS STRUCK BY A LIGHTING 55 (FOOTNOTE), WHICH CAUSED HER TO LOSE CONTROL AND CRASH.


THE SPACE CRAFT IS OPERATED BY IS-BES WHO USE "DOLL BODIES" IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT AN ACTOR WEARS A MASK AND COSTUME. IT IS A LIKE A MECHANICAL TOOL THROUGH WHICH TO OPERATE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD. SHE, AS WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER IS-BES OF THE OFFICER CLASS AND THEIR SUPERIORS, INHABIT THESE "DOLL BODIES" WHEN THEY ARE ON DUTY IN SPACE. WHEN THEY ARE NOT ON DUTY, THEY "LEAVE" THE BODY AND OPERATE, THINK, COMMUNICATE, TRAVEL, AND EXIST WITHOUT THE USE OF A BODY.


THE BODIES ARE CONSTRUCTED OF SYNTHETIC MATERIALS, INCLUDING A VERY SENSITIVE ELECTRICAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, TO WHICH EACH IS-BE ADJUSTS THEMSELVES OR "TUNE IN" TO AN ELECTRONIC WAVE LENGTH 56 (FOOTNOTE) THAT IS MATCHED UNIQUELY TO THE WAVELENGTH OR FREQUENCY EMITTED BY EACH IS-BE.

 

EACH IS-BE IS CAPABLE OF CREATING A UNIQUE WAVE FREQUENCY WHICH IDENTIFIES THEM, MUCH LIKE A RADIO SIGNAL FREQUENCY. THIS SERVES, IN PART, AS IDENTIFICATION LIKE A FINGER PRINT. THE DOLL BODY ACTS LIKE A RADIO RECEIVER FOR THE IS-BE. NO TWO FREQUENCIES OR DOLL BODIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.


THE BODIES OF EACH IS-BE CREW MEMBER ARE LIKEWISE TUNED INTO AND CONNECTED TO THE "NERVOUS SYSTEM" BUILT INTO THE SPACE CRAFT. THE SPACE CRAFT IS BUILT IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THE DOLL BODY. IT IS ADJUSTED SPECIFICALLY TO THE FREQUENCY OF EACH IS-BE CREW MEMBER. THEREFORE, THE CRAFT CAN BE OPERATED BY THE "THOUGHTS" OR ENERGY EMITTED BY THE IS-BE. IT IS REALLY A VERY SIMPLE, DIRECT CONTROL SYSTEM. SO, THERE ARE NO COMPLICATED CONTROLS OR NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT ON BOARD THE SPACE CRAFT. THEY OPERATE AS AN EXTENSION OF THE IS-BE.


WHEN THE LIGHTNING BOLT STRUCK THE SPACE CRAFT THIS CAUSED A SHORT CIRCUIT AND CONSEQUENTLY "DISCONNECTED" THEM FROM THE CONTROL OF THE SHIP MOMENTARILY WHICH RESULTED IN THE CRASH.


AIRL WAS, AND STILL IS, AN OFFICER, PILOT AND ENGINEER IN AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE WHICH IS PART OF A SPACE OPERA 57 (FOOTNOTE) CIVILIZATION WHICH REFERS TO ITSELF AS "THE DOMAIN". THIS CIVILIZATION CONTROLS A VAST NUMBER OF GALAXIES, STARS, PLANETS, MOONS AND ASTEROIDS THROUGHOUT AN AREA OF SPACE THAT IS APPROXIMATELY ONE-FOURTH OF THE ENTIRE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE!

 

THE CONTINUING MISSION OF HER ORGANIZATION IS TO "SECURE, CONTROL AND EXPAND THE TERRITORY AND RESOURCES OF THE DOMAIN".


AIRL POINTED OUT THAT THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES WERE VERY SIMILAR IN MANY WAYS TO THE EUROPEAN EXPLORERS WHO "DISCOVERED" AND "CLAIMED" THE NEW WORLD FOR THE HOLY FATHER, THE POPE AND FOR THE KINGS OF SPAIN, PORTUGAL AND LATER, HOLLAND, ENGLAND, FRANCE AND SO FORTH.

 

EUROPE BENEFITED FROM THE PROPERTY "ACQUIRED" FROM THE NATIVE INHABITANTS. HOWEVER, THE NATIVE INHABITANTS WERE NEVER CONSULTED WITH OR ASKED FOR THEIR PERMISSION TO BECOME A PART OF THE "DOMAIN" OF EUROPEAN NATIONS AND THE SOLDIERS AND PRIESTS THEY SENT TO ACQUIRE TERRITORY AND WEALTH IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS.


AIRL SAID SHE READ IN A HISTORY BOOK THAT THE SPANISH KING REGRETTED THE BRUTAL TREATMENT OF THE NATIVE INHABITANTS BY HIS SOLDIERS. HE FEARED RETRIBUTION FROM THE GODS HE WORSHIPPED, AS DESCRIBED IN THE VARIOUS TESTAMENTS OF THE BIBLE. HE ASKED THE POPE TO PREPARE A STATEMENT CALLED "THE REQUIREMENT" 58 (FOOTNOTE) WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE READ TO EACH OF THE NEWLY ENCOUNTERED NATIVE INHABITANTS.
 

THE KING HOPED THAT THE STATEMENT, WHETHER IT WAS ACCEPTED OR REJECTED BY THE NATIVES, WOULD ABSOLVE THE KING OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESULTING SLAUGHTER AND ENSLAVEMENT OF THESE PEOPLE. HE USED THIS STATEMENT AS JUSTIFICATION TO CONFISCATE THEIR LANDS AND POSSESSIONS BY HIS SOLDIERS AND THE POPE'S PRIESTS. APPARENTLY, THE POPE, PERSONALLY, DID NOT HAVE ANY FEELINGS OF GUILT OR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MATTER.


AIRL THOUGHT THAT SUCH ACTIONS WERE THOSE OF A COWARD AND THAT IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE TERRITORY OF SPAIN WAS DIMINISHED SO QUICKLY. ONLY A FEW YEARS LATER THE KING WAS DEAD AND HIS EMPIRE HAD BEEN ASSIMILATED BY OTHER NATIONS.


AIRL SAID THAT THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR DOES NOT OCCUR IN THE DOMAIN. THEIR LEADERS ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE DOMAIN, AND WOULD NOT DENIGRATE THEMSELVES IN THIS FASHION. NOR DO THEY FEAR ANY GODS OR HAVE ANY REGRET FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THIS IDEA REINFORCES MY EARLIER SUGGESTION THAT AIRL AND HER PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY ATHEISTS.


IN THE CASE OF THE ACQUISITION OF EARTH BY THE DOMAIN, THE RULERS OF THE DOMAIN HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO OPENLY REVEAL THIS INTENTION TO THE "NATIVE INHABITANTS" OF EARTH UNTIL A LATER TIME WHEN IT MAY, OR MAY NOT, SUIT THEIR INTERESTS TO REVEAL THEMSELVES. FOR THE PRESENT TIME, IT IS NOT STRATEGICALLY NECESSARY TO MAKE THE PRESENCE OF THE DOMAIN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE KNOWN TO MANKIND. IN FACT, UNTIL NOW, IT HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVELY HIDDEN, FOR REASONS THAT WILL BE REVEALED LATER.


THE ASTEROID BELT NEAR EARTH IS A VERY SMALL, BUT IMPORTANT LOCATION FOR THE DOMAIN IN THIS PART OF SPACE. ACTUALLY, SOME OF THE OBJECTS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM ARE VERY VALUABLE FOR USE AS LOW-GRAVITY "SPACE STATIONS". THEY ARE INTERESTED PRIMARILY IN THE LOW GRAVITY SATELLITES IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF THE SIDE OF THE MOON FACING AWAY FROM EARTH 59 (FOOTNOTE) AND THE ASTEROID BELT, WHICH WAS A PLANET THAT WAS DESTROYED BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO, AND TO A LESSER DEGREE, MARS AND VENUS.

 

DOOM STRUCTURES SYNTHESIZED FROM GYPSUM 60 (FOOTNOTE) OR UNDERGROUND BASES COVERED BY ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE SCREENS 61 (FOOTNOTE) ARE EASILY CONSTRUCTED TO HOUSE THE DOMAIN FORCES.


ONCE AN AREA OF SPACE IS ACQUIRED BY THE DOMAIN AND BECOMES A PART OF THE TERRITORY UNDER ITS CONTROL, IT IS TREATED AS THE "PROPERTY" OF THE DOMAIN. THE SPACE STATION NEAR THE PLANET EARTH IS IMPORTANT ONLY BECAUSE IT LAY ALONG A PATH OF THE DOMAIN EXPANSION ROUTE TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY AND BEYOND.

 

OF COURSE, EVERYONE IN THE DOMAIN IS AWARE OF THIS -EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE OF EARTH."

48 "...PETER PAN..."
PETER PAN IS A CHARACTER CREATED BY SCOTTISH NOVELIST AND PLAYWRIGHT J. M. BARRIE (1860¬1937). A MISCHIEVOUS BOY WHO FLIES AND MAGICALLY REFUSES TO GROW UP, PETER PAN SPENDS HIS NEVER-ENDING CHILDHOOD ADVENTURING ON THE SMALL ISLAND OF NEVERLAND AS THE LEADER OF HIS GANG THE LOST BOYS, INTERACTING WITH FAIRIES AND PIRATES, AND FROM TIME TO TIME MEETING ORDINARY CHILDREN FROM THE WORLD OUTSIDE.


BARRIE NEVER DESCRIBED PETER'S APPEARANCE IN DETAIL, LEAVING MUCH OF IT TO THE IMAGINATION OF THE READER AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ANYONE ADAPTING THE CHARACTER. HE DESCRIBES HIM AS A BEAUTIFUL BOY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SMILE, "CLAD IN SKELETON LEAVES AND THE JUICES THAT FLOW FROM TREES".


PETER IS MAINLY AN EXAGGERATED STEREOTYPE OF A BOASTFUL AND CARELESS BOY. HE IS QUICK TO POINT OUT HOW GREAT HE IS. PETER HAS A NONCHALANT, DEVIL-MAY-CARE ATTITUDE, AND IS FEARLESSLY COCKY WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING HIMSELF IN DANGER. BARRIE WRITES THAT WHEN PETER THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DIE ON MAROONER'S ROCK, HE FELT SCARED, YET HE FELT ONLY ONE SHUDDER RUN THROUGH HIM WHEN ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD'VE FELT SCARED UP UNTIL DEATH. WITH HIS BLISSFUL UNAWARENESS OF THE TRAGEDY OF DEATH, HE SAYS, "TO DIE WILL BE AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE".


PETER'S ARCHETYPAL ABILITY IS HIS REFUSAL TO GROW UP. BARRIE DID NOT EXPLAIN HOW HE WAS ABLE TO DO THIS, LEAVING THE IMPLICATION THAT IT WAS BY AN ACT OF WILL.


PETER IS A SKILLED SWORDSMAN, WITH THE SKILL TO RIVAL EVEN CAPTAIN HOOK, WHOSE HAND HE CUT OFF IN A DUEL. HE HAS REMARKABLY KEEN VISION AND HEARING. PETER PAN IS SAID TO BE ABLE TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING. PETER HAS AN EFFECT ON THE WHOLE OF NEVERLAND AND ITS INHABITANTS WHEN HE IS THERE. BARRIE STATES THAT THE ISLAND WAKES UP WHEN HE RETURNS FROM HIS TRIP TO LONDON. PETER IS THE LEADER OF THE LOST BOYS, A BAND OF BOYS WHO WERE LOST BY THEIR PARENTS, AND CAME TO LIVE IN NEVERLAND. HE IS FRIENDS WITH TINKER BELL, A COMMON FAIRY WHO IS OFTEN JEALOUSLY PROTECTIVE OF HIM."

WITH IRVING'S COMPANION PIECE "RIP VAN WINKLE", "THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW" IS AMONG THE EARLIEST AMERICAN FICTION STILL READ TODAY.


THE STORY IS SET CIRCA 1790 IN THE DUTCH SETTLEMENT OF TARRY TOWN, NEW YORK, IN A SECLUDED GLEN CALLED SLEEPY HOLLOW. IT TELLS THE STORY OF ICHABOD CRANE, A LANKY SCHOOLMASTER FROM CONNECTICUT, WHO COMPETES WITH ABRAHAM "BROM BONES" VAN BRUNT, THE TOWN ROWDY, FOR THE HAND OF 18-YEAR-OLD KATRINA VAN TASSEL, ONLY DAUGHTER OF A WEALTHY FARMER.

 

AS CRANE LEAVES A PARTY AT THE VAN TASSEL HOME ON AN AUTUMN NIGHT, HE IS PURSUED BY THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN, SUPPOSEDLY THE GHOST OF A HESSIAN TROOPER WHO LOST HIS HEAD TO A CANNONBALL DURING "SOME NAMELESS BATTLE" OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND WHO "RIDES FORTH TO THE SCENE OF BATTLE IN NIGHTLY QUEST OF HIS HEAD."

"SANSKRIT (SA SK TA VAK, FOR SHORT SA SK TAM) IS A CLASSICAL LANGUAGE OF SOUTH ASIA, A LITURGICAL LANGUAGE OF HINDUISM, BUDDHISM, SIKHISM, JAINISM, AND ONE OF THE 23 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF INDIA.


ITS POSITION IN THE CULTURES OF SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA IS AKIN TO THAT OF LATIN AND GREEK IN EUROPE AND IT HAS EVOLVED INTO, AS WELL AS INFLUENCED, MANY MODERN-DAY LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD. IT APPEARS IN PRE-CLASSICAL FORM AS VEDIC SANSKRIT, WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE RIGVEDA BEING THE OLDEST AND MOST ARCHAIC STAGE PRESERVED. DATING BACK TO AS EARLY AS 1500 BCE, VEDIC SANSKRIT IS THE EARLIEST ATTESTED INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGE, AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST ATTESTED MEMBERS OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE FAMILY.


THE CORPUS OF SANSKRIT LITERATURE ENCOMPASSES A RICH TRADITION OF POETRY AND DRAMA AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS TEXTS. TODAY, SANSKRIT CONTINUES TO BE WIDELY USED AS A CEREMONIAL LANGUAGE IN HINDU RELIGIOUS RITUALS IN THE FORMS OF HYMNS AND MANTRAS. SPOKEN SANSKRIT IS STILL IN USE IN A FEW TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN INDIA, AND THERE ARE SOME ATTEMPTS AT REVIVAL.


THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THE CLASSICAL SANSKRIT LANGUAGE AS LAID OUT IN THE GRAMMAR OF PANINI, AROUND THE 4TH CENTURY BCE."

-- EDITOR'S NOTE: (THE WESTERN BORDERS OF PAKISTAN INCLUDE THE KHYBER PASS AND BOLAN PASS, TRADITIONAL INVASION ROUTES BETWEEN CENTRAL ASIA. THE CLOSEST CIVILIZATION USING SANSKRIT AT THE DATE AND NEAREST THE LOCATION OF "THE DOMAIN BASE" WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HIMALAYAS. THIS WAS THE IN THE AREA OF "MEHRGARH", AN EARLY BEGINNING OF THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN RECENTLY EXCAVATED.)


"(BOLAN PASS (URDU: درہ بولان) IS A MOUNTAIN PASS THROUGH THE TOBA KAKAR RANGE OF MOUNTAINS IN WESTERN PAKISTAN, 120 KILOMETERS FROM THE AFGHANISTAN BORDER. STRATEGICALLY LOCATED, TRADERS, INVADERS, AND NOMADIC TRIBES HAVE ALSO USED IT AS A GATEWAY TO AND FROM THE SOUTH ASIA.)


THE KHYBER PASS, (ALSO SPELLED KHAIBER OR KHAYBAR) (URDU: درہ خیبر) (ALTITUDE: 1,070 M, 3,510 FT) IS THE MOUNTAIN PASS THAT LINKS PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN. THROUGHOUT HISTORY IT HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT TRADE ROUTE BETWEEN CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTH ASIA AND A STRATEGIC MILITARY LOCATION.


"MEHRGARH IS NOW SEEN AS A PRECURSOR TO THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION. "DISCOVERIES AT MEHRGARH CHANGED THE ENTIRE CONCEPT OF THE INDUS CIVILIZATION," ACCORDING TO AHMAD HASAN DANI, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF ARCHAEOLOGY AT QUAID-E-AZAM UNIVERSITY, ISLAMABAD, "THERE WE HAVE THE WHOLE SEQUENCE, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF SETTLED VILLAGE LIFE.


THE KACHI PLAIN AND IN THE BOLAN BASIN (ARE) SITUATED AT THE BOLAN PEAK PASS, ONE OF THE MAIN ROUTES CONNECTING SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN, EASTERN IRAN, THE BALOCHISTAN HILLS AND THE INDUS VALLEY. THIS AREA OF ROLLING HILLS IS THUS LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE INDUS VALLEY, WHERE, AROUND 2500 BC, A LARGE URBAN CIVILIZATION EMERGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THOSE OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN EMPIRE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT, A CONTINUOUS SEQUENCE OF DWELLING-SITES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FROM 7000 BC TO 500 BC. THE CHALCOLITHIC PEOPLE OF MEHRGARH ALSO HAD CONTACTS WITH CONTEMPORANEOUS CULTURES IN NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN, NORTHEASTERN IRAN AND SOUTHERN CENTRAL ASIA.


IN APRIL 2006, IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL NATURE THAT THE OLDEST (AND FIRST EARLY NEOLITHIC) EVIDENCE FOR THE DRILLING OF HUMAN TEETH IN VIVO (I.E. IN A LIVING PERSON) WAS FOUND IN MEHRGARH. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, THEIR DISCOVERIES POINT TO A TRADITION OF PROTO-DENTISTRY IN THE EARLY FARMING CULTURES OF THAT REGION. "HERE WE DESCRIBE ELEVEN DRILLED MOLAR CROWNS FROM NINE ADULTS DISCOVERED IN A NEOLITHIC GRAVEYARD IN PAKISTAN THAT DATES FROM 7,500 TO 9,000 YEARS AGO."

52 "... THEY REPORTED SIGHTING "VIMANAS" OR SPACE CRAFT IN THE AREA.."
"A VIMANA (SANSKRIT: FASRA) IS A MYTHICAL FLYING MACHINE, DESCRIBED IN THE SANSKRIT EPICS. THE PREDECESSORS OF THE FLYING VIMANAS OF THE SANSKRIT EPICS ARE THE FLYING CHARIOTS EMPLOYED BY VARIOUS GODS IN THE VEDAS.


THE FIRST FLYING VIMANA MENTIONED IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY:


"THE PUSHPAKA CHARIOT THAT RESEMBLES THE SUN AND BELONGS TO MY BROTHER WAS BROUGHT BY THE POWERFUL RAVANA; THAT AERIAL AND EXCELLENT CAR GOING EVERYWHERE AT WILL.... THAT CAR RESEMBLING A BRIGHT CLOUD IN THE SKY... AND THE KING [RAMA] GOT IN, AND THE EXCELLENT CAR AT THE COMMAND OF THE RAGHIRA, ROSE UP INTO THE HIGHER ATMOSPHERE.'


THE RIGVEDA DOES NOT MENTION VIMANAS, BUT VERSES RV1.164.47-48 HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS EVIDENCE FOR THE IDEA OF "MECHANICAL BIRDS":

"DARK THE DESCENT: THE BIRDS ARE GOLDEN-COLOURED; UP TO THE HEAVEN THEY FLY ROBED IN THE WATERS. AGAIN DESCEND THEY FROM THE SEAT OF ORDER, AND ALL THE EARTH IS MOISTENED WITH THEIR FATNESS."
"TWELVE ARE THE FELLIES, AND THE WHEEL IS SINGLE; THREE ARE THE NAVES. WHAT MAN HATH UNDERSTOOD IT?
THEREIN ARE SET TOGETHER SPOKES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY, WHICH IN NOWISE CAN BE LOOSENED." (TRANS. GRIFFITH)

IN DAYANANDA SARASWATI'S "TRANSLATION", THESE VERSES BECOME:

"JUMPING INTO SPACE SPEEDILY WITH A CRAFT USING FIRE AND WATER... CONTAINING TWELVE STAMGHAS (PILLARS), ONE WHEEL, THREE MACHINES, 300 PIVOTS, AND 60 INSTRUMENTS."

BUT LIKELIER IN THE ORIGINAL INDIAN SYMBOLISM WHEN THAT HYMN WAS COMPOSED, THE WHEEL IS A YEAR, THE 12 "FELLIES" ARE MONTHS (LUNATIONS), AND THE 360 SPOKES ARE DAYS.


IN THE RAMAYANA, THE PUSHPAKA ("FLOWERY") VIMANA OF RAVANA IS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:

"THE PUSHPAKA CHARIOT THAT RESEMBLES THE SUN AND BELONGS TO MY BROTHER WAS BROUGHT BY THE POWERFUL RAVANA; THAT AERIAL AND EXCELLENT CAR GOING EVERYWHERE AT WILL.... THAT CAR RESEMBLING A BRIGHT CLOUD IN THE SKY... AND THE KING [RAMA] GOT IN, AND THE EXCELLENT CAR AT THE COMMAND OF THE RAGHIRA, ROSE UP INTO THE HIGHER ATMOSPHERE."

IT IS THE FIRST FLYING VIMANA MENTIONED IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY (AS DISTINCT FROM THE GODS' FLYING HORSE-DRAWN CHARIOTS).
PUSHPAKA WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY MAYA FOR KUBERA, THE GOD OF WEALTH, BUT WAS LATER STOLEN, ALONG WITH LANKA, BY HIS HALF-BROTHER, THE DEMON KING RAVANA.


ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE ASURA MAYA HAD A VIMANA MEASURING TWELVE CUBITS IN CIRCUMFERENCE, WITH FOUR STRONG WHEELS. APART FROM 'BLAZING MISSILES', THE POEM RECORDS THE USE OF OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS. 'INDRA'S DART' (INDRAVAJRA) OPERATED VIA A CIRCULAR 'REFLECTOR1. WHEN SWITCHED ON, IT PRODUCED A 'SHAFT OF LIGHT' WHICH, WHEN FOCUSED ON ANY TARGET, IMMEDIATELY 'CONSUMED IT WITH ITS POWER'.


IN ONE EXCHANGE, THE HERO, KRISHNA, IS PURSUING HIS ENEMY, SALVA, IN THE SKY, WHEN SALVA'S VIMANA, THE SAUBHA, IS MADE INVISIBLE IN SOME WAY. UNDETERRED, KRISHNA IMMEDIATELY FIRES OFF A SPECIAL WEAPON: "I QUICKLY LAID ON AN ARROW, WHICH KILLED BY SEEKING OUT SOUND".


MANY OTHER TERRIBLE WEAPONS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE MAHABHARATA, BUT THE MOST FEARSOME OF ALL IS THE ONE USED AGAINST THE VRISHIS. THE NARRATIVE RECORDS:

 

"GURKHA FLYING IN HIS SWIFT AND POWERFUL VIMANA HURLED AGAINST THE THREE CITIES OF THE VRISHNIS AND ANDHAKAS A SINGLE PROJECTILE CHARGED WITH ALL THE POWER OF THE UNIVERSE. AN INCANDESCENT COLUMN OF SMOKE AND FIRE, AS BRILLIANT AS TEN THOUSANDS SUNS, ROSE IN ALL ITS SPLENDOUR. IT WAS THE UNKNOWN WEAPON, THE IRON THUNDERBOLT, A GIGANTIC MESSENGER OF DEATH WHICH REDUCED TO ASHES THE ENTIRE RACE OF THE VRISHNIS AND ANDHAKAS."

54 "... I WAS "OUTSIDE" OF MY BODY, LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CEILING..."

"AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE (OBE), IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT TYPICALLY INVOLVES A SENSATION OF FLOATING OUTSIDE OF ONE'S BODY AND, IN SOME CASES, PERCEIVING ONE'S PHYSICAL BODY FROM A PLACE OUTSIDE ONE'S BODY (AUTOSCOPY). ABOUT ONE IN TEN PEOPLE HAS REPORTED HAVING AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES. IT IS CLAIMED THAT THOSE EXPERIENCING AN OBE SOMETIMES OBSERVE DETAILS WHICH WERE UNKNOWN TO THEM BEFOREHAND.
 

THE FIRST EXTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF OBES WAS MADE BY CELIA GREEN (1968). SHE COLLECTED WRITTEN, FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS FROM A TOTAL OF 400 SUBJECTS, RECRUITED BY MEANS OF APPEALS IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, AND FOLLOWED UP BY QUESTIONNAIRE. SOME 80% REPORTED FEELING THEY WERE A 'DISEMBODIED CONSCIOUSNESS', WITH NO EXTERNAL BODY AT ALL.


ANOTHER FORM OF A SPONTANEOUS OBE OCCURS DURING A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE (NDE). THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF AN NDE USUALLY INCLUDES PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND TRANSCENDENTAL FACTORS (PARNIA, WALLER, YEATES & FENWICK, 2001) SUCH AS IMPRESSIONS OF BEING OUTSIDE THE PHYSICAL BODY (AN OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE), TYPICALLY THE EXPERIENCE FOLLOWS A DISTINCT PROGRESSION, STARTING WITH THE SENSATION OF FLOATING ABOVE ONE'S BODY AND SEEING THE SURROUNDING AREA."

EXAMPLES OF WAVE-LIKE PHENOMENA ARE LIGHT, WATER WAVES, AND SOUND WAVES. IN A WAVE, A PROPERTY VARIES WITH THE POSITION.

 

FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PROPERTY CAN BE THE AIR PRESSURE FOR A SOUND WAVE, OR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ELECTRIC OR THE MAGNETIC FIELD FOR LIGHT. THE WAVELENGTHS OF FREQUENCIES AUDIBLE TO THE HUMAN EAR (20 HZ–20 KHZ) ARE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 17 M AND 17 MM, RESPECTIVELY.

THE TRANSITION FROM THE OLDER SPACE-VOYAGE STORY TO THE SPACE OPERA CAN BE SEEN IN THE WORKS OF E. E. "DOC" SMITH. HIS FIRST PUBLISHED WORK, THE SKYLARK OF SPACE (AUGUST-OCTOBER 1928, AMAZING STORIES), MERGES THE TRADITIONAL TALE OF A SCIENTIST INVENTING A SPACE-DRIVE WITH PLANETARY ROMANCE IN THE STYLE OF EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS; BUT BY THE TIME OF THE SEQUEL, SKYLARK THREE (AUGUST-OCTOBER 1930, AMAZING STORIES) WHICH INTRODUCES THE SPACE FARING RACE OF THE FENACHRONE, SMITH HAD MOVED CLOSER TO A SPACE OPERA MODE.

 

SPACE OPERA IN ITS MOST FAMILIAR FORM WAS A PRODUCT OF 1930S-40S PULP MAGAZINES. LIKE EARLY SCIENCE FICTION IN GENERAL, SPACE OPERA BORROWED MUCH OF ITS STYLE FROM ESTABLISHED ADVENTURE, CRIME, AND THRILLER GENRES. NOTABLE INFLUENCES INCLUDED STORIES THAT DESCRIBED ADVENTURES ON EXOTIC OR UNCIVILIZED FRONTIERS, E.G. THE AMERICAN WEST, AFRICA, OR THE ORIENT.

 

THE IMAGINED FUTURE OF SPACE OPERA INCLUDED IMMENSE SPACE LINERS, INTREPID EXPLORERS OF UNKNOWN WORLDS, PIRATES OF THE SPACE WAYS, AND TOUGH BUT INCORRUPTIBLE SPACE POLICE.


E.E."DOC" SMITH'S LATER LENSMAN SERIES AND THE WORKS OF EDMOND HAMILTON, JOHN W. CAMPBELL, AND JACK WILLIAMSON IN THE 1930S AND 1940S WERE POPULAR WITH READERS AND MUCH IMITATED BY OTHER WRITERS. BY THE EARLY 1940S, THE REPETITIOUSNESS AND EXTRAVAGANCE OF SOME OF THESE STORIES LED TO OBJECTIONS FROM SOME FANS."

58 "...1493 AD -- "THE REQUIREMENT"...
"THE REQUIREMENT WAS PUBLISHED AS A PAPAL "BULL", ISSUED BY THE INFAMOUS POPE ALEXANDER VI, (RODRIGO BORGIA), ROMAN CATHOLIC POPE FROM 1492 UNTIL HIS DEATH, IS THE MOST MEMORABLE OF THE POPES OF THE RENAISSANCE.


BECAUSE OF THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AMERICAS IN 1493, THE KING OF SPAIN, HAD A SMALL TWINGE OF FEAR AT THE PROSPECT THAT GOD MIGHT BECOME ANGRY AT HIM FOR ALL THE MURDER, THEFT AND MAYHEM HE ENDORSED IN THE NEW WORLD. SO, HE PERSUADED POPE ALEXANDER VI TO SANCTION AN OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION INTENDED TO DISSOLVE THE STAIN OF BLOODY CULPABILITY FROM THE KING'S OWN IMMORTAL SOUL.

 

THIS DOCUMENT, CALLED "THE REQUIREMENT", WAS SUPPOSED TO BE READ, WHETHER TRANSLATED INTO THE NATIVE LANGUAGE OF THE INHABITANTS OR NOT, TO THE CITIZENS OF EVERY FOREIGN NATION JUST PRIOR TO THEIR CONQUEST. THE GIST OF THE PROCLAMATION WAS TO INFORM THE SOON TO BE VANQUISHED THAT THEIR LANDS WERE BEING "DONATED" TO SPAIN.
 

THE REQUIREMENT READ, IN PART:

"I, (NAME OF THE CONQUISTADOR), SERVANT OF THE HIGH AND MIGHTY KINGS OF CASTILE AND LEON, CONQUERORS OF BARBARIAN PEOPLES, AND BEING THEIR MESSENGER AND CAPTAIN, HEREBY NOTIFY AND INFORM YOU... THAT GOD OUR LORD, ONE AND ETERNAL, CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH AND A MAN AND A WOMAN FROM WHOM YOU AND I AND ALL THE MULTITUDE BEGOTTEN FROM THESE OVER THE PAST FIVE THOUSAND AND SOME YEARS SINCE THE WORLD WAS MADE ...

 

AND SO I REQUEST AND REQUIRE YOU... TO RECOGNIZE THE CHURCH AS YOUR MISTRESS AND AS GOVERNESS OF THE WORLD AND UNIVERSE, AND THE HIGH PRIEST, CALLED THE POPE, IN HER NAME, AND HIS MAJESTY (THE KING OF SPAIN) IN HER PLACE, AS RULER AND LORD KING ... AND IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS... WITH THE HELP OF GOD I SHALL COME MIGHTILY AGAINST YOU, AND I SHALL MAKE WAR ON YOU EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY WAY THAT I CAN, AND I SHALL SUBJECT YOU TO THE YOKE AND OBEDIENCE OF THE CHURCH AND HIS MAJESTY, AND I SHALL SEIZE YOUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND I SHALL MAKE THEM SLAVES, TO SELL AND DISPOSE OF AS HIS MAJESTY COMMANDS, AND I SHALL DO ALL THE EVIL AND DAMAGE TO YOU THAT I AM ABLE.

 

AND I INSIST THAT THE DEATHS AND DESTRUCTION THAT RESULT FROM THIS WILL BE YOUR FAULT."

ONE OF THE FIRST TO HEAR THE REQUIREMENT WERE THE CHIEFS OF THE MAYA, WHOSE SCALE OF TIME FOR THE CREATION OF LIFE ON EARTH DID NOT BEGIN A MERE 5,000 YEARS EARLIER, AS SUGGESTED BY THE POPE, RATHER THE MAYAN MEASURED ORIGINAL CREATION IN MILLIONS OF YEARS BY THE ASTRONOMICAL CALENDARS THEY KEPT, WHICH TRACKED THE SOLAR YEAR ACCURATELY TO WITHIN A FEW SECONDS A YEAR. THEIR COMMENT UPON HEARING THE REQUIREMENT WAS, "THE HOLY FATHER HAS INDEED BEEN GENEROUS WITH OTHERS' PROPERTY".


THE REQUIREMENT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS A RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS BY SPANISH CLERICS THAT THE WARS AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLES WERE UNJUST. COMPARING THEM TO SPAIN'S WARS AGAINST THE MOORS, THE CLERICS CLAIMED THAT MUSLIMS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST AND REJECTED HIM, SO THAT WAGING A CRUSADE AGAINST THEM WAS LEGITIMATE. IN CONTRAST, WARS AGAINST THE NATIVE AMERICANS, WHO HAD NEVER COME INTO CONTACT WITH CHRISTIANITY WERE UNACCEPTABLE.

 

THE REQUIREMENT WAS INTENDED AS A LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO PLACE THE NATIVE POPULATION IN THE POSITION OF HAVING REJECTED CHRISTIANITY. IT STATED:

"WE PROTEST THAT ANY DEATHS THAT RESULT FROM THIS [REJECTION OF CHRISTIANITY] ARE YOUR FAULT..."

MANY CRITICS OF THE CONQUISTADORS' POLICIES WERE APPALLED BY THE FLIPPANT NATURE OF THE REQUIREMENT, AND THE PRIEST, BARTOLOMEO DE LAS CASAS, SAID IN RESPONSE TO IT THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO LAUGH OR TO CRY. WHILE THE CONQUISTADORS WERE ENCOURAGED TO USE AN INTERPRETER TO READ THE REQUIREMENT, THIS WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, AND IN MANY CASES, IT WAS READ OUT TO AN UNCOMPREHENDING POPULACE. IN SOME INSTANCES, IT WAS READ TO BARREN BEACHES AND EMPTY VILLAGES, LONG AFTER THE NATIVES HAD FLED, TO PRISONERS AFTER THEY WERE CAPTURED, OR EVEN FROM THE DECKS OF SHIPS ONCE THEY HAD JUST SPOTTED THE COAST.

 

NEVERTHELESS, FOR THE CONQUISTADORS, IT PROVIDED A RELIGIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR ATTACKING AND ENSLAVING THE NATIVE POPULATION, AND BECAUSE OF ITS POTENTIAL TO ENRICH THE COFFERS OF SPAIN, THE REQUIREMENT WAS NOT GENERALLY QUESTIONED."

THE NET RESULT OF THE "DISCOVERY"" OF THE "NEW WORLD" WHICH WASN'T REALLY "NEW" AS IT HAD BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS ANY OTHER CONTINENT, AND HAD A LARGER POPULATION THAN EUROPE, WAS AS FOLLOWS:

1) HUNDREDS OF INDIGENOUS CULTURES WERE ERADICATED

2) APPROXIMATELY 100 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY DISEASE AND WAR BROUGHT UPON THEM BY "ALIENS"

3) 100 MILLION PEOPLE FROM THE GOLD COAST OF AFRICA WERE ENSLAVED, AND/ OR MURDERED BY EUROPEANS IN AN EFFORT TO REPLACE THE "LABOR FORCE" OF SLAUGHTERED INDIGENOUS POPULATION OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE

4) NEARLY ALL OF THE PRICELESS LITERATURE, HISTORY, CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC ARTIFACTS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE WERE DESTROYED

5) MOST OF THE GOLD AND GEMS MINED OVER A PERIOD OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE STOLEN AND SHIPPED OFF THE A HANDFUL OF GREEDY, IDIOTIC, UNEDUCATED, FILTHY, DISEASE-RIDDEN, SUPERSTITIOUS, MURDEROUS, THIEVES IN EUROPE WHO SQUANDERED IT ON MINDLESS SELF-INDULGENCES.

59 "... THEY ARE INTERESTED PRIMARILY IN THE "LOW GRAVITY" SATELLITES IN THIS SPACE STATION WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...".
"ACCORDING TO THE NASA ASTRONAUT NEIL ARMSTRONG THE ALIENS HAVE A BASE ON THE MOON AND (THE ALIENS) TOLD US IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS TO GET OFF AND STAY OFF THE MOON!


SOUND FAR FETCHED? MILTON COOPER, A NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER TELLS US THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE ALIEN MOON BASE EXIST BUT THE U.S. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY REFERS TO THE ALIEN MOON BASE AS "LUNA," THAT THERE IS A HUGE MINING OPERATION GOING ON THERE, AND THAT IS WHERE THE ALIENS KEEP THEIR HUGE MOTHER SHIPS WHILE THE TRIPS TO EARTH ARE MADE IN SMALLER "FLYING SAUCERS".

LUNA: THE ALIEN BASE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON. IT WAS SEEN AND FILMED BY THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS. A BASE, A MINING OPERATION USING VERY LARGE MACHINES, AND THE VERY LARGE ALIEN CRAFT DESCRIBED IN SIGHTING REPORTS AS MOTHER SHIPS EXIST THERE.

-MILTON COOPER

DID APOLLO 11 ENCOUNTER UFOS ON THE MOON? FROM THE BOOK "ABOVE TOP SECRET" BY TIMOTHY GOOD.


ACCORDING TO HITHERTO UNCONFIRMED REPORTS, BOTH NEIL ARMSTRONG AND EDWIN "BUZZ" ALDRIN SAW UFOS SHORTLY AFTER THEIR HISTORIC LANDING ON THE MOON IN APOLLO 11 ON 21 JULY 1969. I REMEMBER HEARING ONE OF THE ASTRONAUTS REFER TO A "LIGHT" IN OR ON A CARTER DURING THE TELEVISION TRANSMISSION, FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FROM MISSION CONTROL FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD.


ACCORDING TO A FORMER NASA EMPLOYEE OTTO BINDER, UNNAMED RADIO HAMS WITH THEIR OWN VHF RECEIVING FACILITIES THAT BYPASSED NASA'S BROADCASTING OUTLETS PICKED UP THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE:

NASA: WHAT'S THERE? MISSION CONTROL CALLING APOLLO 11...
APOLLO: THESE "BABIES" ARE HUGE, SIR! ENORMOUS! OH MY GOD! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT! I'M TELLING YOU THERE ARE OTHER SPACECRAFT OUT THERE, LINED UP ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CRATER EDGE! THEY'RE ON THE MOON WATCHING US!

IN 1979, MAURICE CHATELAIN, FORMER CHIEF OF NASA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS CONFIRMED THAT ARMSTRONG HAD INDEED REPORTED SEEING TWO UFOS ON THE RIM OF A CRATER.

"THE ENCOUNTER WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE IN NASA," HE REVEALED, "BUT NOBODY HAS TALKED ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW."

SOVIET SCIENTISTS WERE ALLEGEDLY THE FIRST TO CONFIRM THE INCIDENT. "ACCORDING TO OUR INFORMATION, THE ENCOUNTER WAS REPORTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LANDING OF THE MODULE," SAID DR. VLADIMIR AZHAZHA, A PHYSICIST AND PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AT MOSCOW UNIVERSITY. "NEIL ARMSTRONG RELAYED THE MESSAGE TO MISSION CONTROL THAT TWO LARGE, MYSTERIOUS OBJECTS WERE WATCHING THEM AFTER HAVING LANDED NEAR THE MOON MODULE. BUT HIS MESSAGE WAS NEVER HEARD BY THE PUBLIC-BECAUSE NASA CENSORED IT. "


ACCORDING TO ANOTHER SOVIET SCIENTIST, DR. ALEKSANDR KAZANTSEV, BUZZ ALDRIN TOOK COLOR MOVIE FILM OF THE UFOS FROM INSIDE THE MODULE, AND CONTINUED FILMING THEM AFTER HE AND ARMSTRONG WENT OUTSIDE. DR. AZHAZHA CLAIMS THAT THE UFOS DEPARTED MINUTES AFTER THE ASTRONAUTS CAME OUT ON TO THE LUNAR SURFACE.


MAURICE CHATELAIN ALSO CONFIRMED THAT APOLLO 11'S RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE INTERRUPTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN ORDER TO HIDE THE NEWS FROM THE PUBLIC. BEFORE DISMISSING CHATELAIN'S SENSATIONAL CLAIMS, IT IS WORTH NOTING HIS IMPRESSIVE BACKGROUND IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND SPACE PROGRAM. HIS FIRST JOB AFTER MOVING FROM FRANCE WAS AS AN ELECTRONICS ENGINEER WITH CONVAIR, SPECIALIZING IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TELEMETRY, AND RADAR. IN 1959 HE WAS IN CHARGE OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC RESEARCH GROUP, DEVELOPING NEW RADAR AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FOR RYAN. ONE OF HIS ELEVEN PATENTS WAS AN AUTOMATIC FLIGHTS TO THE MOON. LATER, AT NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION, CHATELAIN WAS OFFERED THE JOB OF DESIGNING AND BUILDING THE APOLLO COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA-PROCESSING SYSTEMS.


CHATELAIN CLAIMS THAT,

"ALL APOLLO AND GEMINI FLIGHTS WERE FOLLOWED, BOTH AT A DISTANCE AND SOMETIMES ALSO QUITE CLOSELY, BY SPACE VEHICLES OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ORIGIN-FLYING SAUCERS, OR UFOS, IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM BY THAT NAME. EVERY TIME IT OCCURRED, THE ASTRONAUTS INFORMED MISSION CONTROL, WHO THEN ORDERED ABSOLUTE SILENCE."

HE GOES ON TO SAY:

"I THINK THAT WALTER SCHIRRA ABOARD MERCURY 8 WAS THE FIRST OF THE ASTRONAUTS TO USE THE CODE NAME 'SANTA CLAUS' TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF FLYING SAUCERS NEXT TO SPACE CAPSULES. HOWEVER, HIS ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE BARELY NOTICED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN JAMES LOVELL ON BOARD THE APOLLO 8 COMMAND MODULE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE MOON AND SAID FOR EVERYBODY TO HEAR:

'PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.'

EVEN THOUGH THIS HAPPENED ON CHRISTMAS DAY 1968, MANY PEOPLE SENSED A HIDDEN MEANING IN THOSE WORDS."

RUMORS PERSIST. NASA MAY WELL BE A CIVILIAN AGENCY, BUT MANY OF ITS PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED BY THE DEFENSE BUDGET AND MOST OF THE ASTRONAUTS ARE SUBJECT TO MILITARY SECURITY REGULATIONS. APART FROM THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SCREENS ALL FILMS AND PROBABLY RADIO COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL. WE HAVE THE STATEMENTS BY OTTO BINDER, DR. GARRY HENDERSON AND MAURICE CHATELAIN THAT THE ASTRONAUTS WERE UNDER STRICT ORDERS NOT TO DISCUSS THEIR SIGHTINGS. AND GORDON COOPER HAS TESTIFIED TO A UNITED NATIONS COMMITTEE THAT ONE OF THE ASTRONAUTS ACTUALLY WITNESSED A UFO ON THE GROUND. IF THERE IS NO SECRECY, WHY HAS THIS SIGHTING NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC?


A CERTAIN PROFESSOR, WHO WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, WAS ENGAGED IN A DISCUSSION WITH NEIL ARMSTRONG DURING A NASA SYMPOSIUM.

PROFESSOR: WHAT REALLY HAPPENED OUT THERE WITH APOLLO 11?
ARMSTRONG: IT WAS INCREDIBLE, OF COURSE WE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY, THE FACT IS, WE WERE WARNED OFF! (BY THE ALIENS). THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION THEN OF A SPACE STATION OR A MOON CITY.
PROFESSOR: HOW DO YOU MEAN "WARNED OFF"?
ARMSTRONG: I CAN'T GO INTO DETAILS, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THEIR SHIPS WERE FAR SUPERIOR TO OURS BOTH IN SIZE AND TECHNOLOGY - BOY, WERE THEY BIG!... AND MENACING! NO, THERE IS NO QUESTION OF A SPACE STATION.
PROFESSOR: BUT NASA HAD OTHER MISSIONS AFTER APOLLO 11?
ARMSTRONG: NATURALLY-NASA WAS COMMITTED AT THAT TIME, AND COULDN'T RISK PANIC ON EARTH. BUT IT REALLY WAS A QUICK SCOOP AND BACK AGAIN.

ARMSTRONG CONFIRMED THAT THE STORY WAS TRUE BUT REFUSED TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL, BEYOND ADMITTING THAT THE CIA WAS BEHIND THE COVER-UP.
REASONABLE ACTIVITY OF AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION SHOWED UP UNEXPECTEDLY CLOSE TO US. WE WERE NOT READY FOR IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY


WE STILL CAN COME ACROSS PUBLICATIONS TRYING TO FIND AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? AT THE SAME TIME, PRESENCE OF REASONABLE CREATURES HAS BEEN DETECTED JUST CLOSE TO OUR HOME, IN THE MOON. HOWEVER, THE DISCOVERY WAS IMMEDIATELY CLASSIFIED AS SECRET, AS IT WAS SO MUCH INCREDIBLE THAT EVEN COULD SHAKE THE ALREADY EXISTING SOCIAL PRINCIPLES, REPORTS RUSSIA'S NEWSPAPER "VECHERNY VOLGOGRAD."


HERE IS AN EXTRACT FROM THE OFFICIAL PRESS-RELEASE:

"NASA SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS PARTICIPATING IN EXPLORATION OF MARS AND MOON REPORTED RESULTS OF THEIR DISCOVERIES AT A BRIEFING AT THE WASHINGTON NATIONAL PRESS CLUB ON MARCH 21, 1996. IT WAS ANNOUNCED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT MAN-CAUSED STRUCTURES AND OBJECTS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE MOON."

THE SCIENTISTS SPOKE RATHER CAUTIOUSLY AND EVASIVELY ABOUT THE FUNCTIONING OBJECTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UFO. THEY ALWAYS MENTIONED THE MAN-CAUSED OBJECTS AS POSSIBLE, AND POINTED OUT THE INFORMATION WAS STILL UNDER STUDY, AND OFFICIAL RESULTS WOULD BE PUBLISHED LATER.


IT WAS MENTIONED AT THE BRIEFING AS WELL THAT THE SOVIET UNION USED TO OWN SOME PHOTO MATERIALS PROVING PRESENCE OF REASONABLE ACTIVITY ON THE MOON. AND ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T IDENTIFIED WHAT KIND OF REASONABLE ACTIVITY IT WAS, THOUSANDS OF PHOTO-AND VIDEO MATERIALS PHOTOGRAPHED FROM THE APOLLO AND THE CLEMENTINE SPACE STATION DEMONSTRATED MANY PARTS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE WHERE THE ACTIVITY AND ITS TRACES WERE PERFECTLY EVIDENT. THE VIDEO FILMS AND PHOTOS MADE BY U.S. ASTRONAUTS DURING THE APOLLO PROGRAM WERE DEMONSTRATED AT THE BRIEFING.

 

AND PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY SURPRISED WHY THE MATERIALS HADN'T BEEN PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EARLIER. AND NASA SPECIALISTS ANSWERED:

"IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE REACTION OF PEOPLE TO THE INFORMATION THAT SOME CREATURES HAD BEEN OR STILL WERE ON THE MOON. BESIDES, THERE WERE SOME OTHER REASONS TO IT, WHICH WERE BEYOND NASA."

SPECIALIST FOR LUNAR ARTIFACTS RICHARD HOAGLAND SAYS THAT NASA IS STILL TRYING TO VEIL PHOTO MATERIALS BEFORE THEY ARE PUBLISHED IN PUBLIC CATALOGUES AND FILES, THEY DO RETOUCHING OR PARTIALLY REFOCUS THEM WHILE COPYING. SOME INVESTIGATORS, HOAGLAND IS AMONG THEM, SUPPOSE THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL RACE HAD USED THE MOON AS A TERMINAL STATION DURING THEIR ACTIVITY ON THE EARTH. THE SUGGESTIONS ARE CONFIRMED BY THE LEGENDS AND MYTHS INVENTED BY DIFFERENT NATIONS OF OUR PLANET.


RUINS OF LUNAR CITIES STRETCHED ALONG MANY KILOMETERS, HUGE TRANSPARENT DOMES ON MASSIVE BASEMENTS, NUMEROUS TUNNELS AND OTHER CONSTRUCTIONS MAKE SCIENTISTS RECONSIDER THEIR OPINIONS CONCERNING THE LUNAR PROBLEMS. HOW THE MOON APPEARED AND PRINCIPLES OF ITS REVOLVING AROUND THE EARTH STILL POSE A GREAT PROBLEM FOR SCIENTISTS.


SOME PARTIALLY DESTROYED OBJECTS ON THE LUNAR SURFACE CAN'T BE PLACED AMONG NATURAL GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS, AS THEY ARE OF COMPLEX ORGANIZATION AND GEOMETRICAL STRUCTURE. IN THE UPPER PART OF RIMA HADLEY, NOT FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE THE APOLLO-15 HAD LANDED, A CONSTRUCTION SURROUNDED WITH A TALL D-SHAPED WALL WAS DISCOVERED. AS OF NOW, DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN 44 REGIONS.


THE NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER, THE HOUSTON PLANETARY INSTITUTE AND SPECIALISTS FROM THE BANK OF SPACE INFORMATION ARE INVESTIGATING THE REGIONS. MYSTERIOUS TERRACE-SHAPED EXCAVATIONS OF THE ROCK HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED NEAR THE TIHO CRATER. THE CONCENTRIC HEXAHEDRAL EXCAVATIONS AND THE TUNNEL ENTRY AT THE TERRACE SIDE CANT BE RESULTS OF NATURAL GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES; INSTEAD, THEY LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE OPEN CAST MINES.
 

A TRANSPARENT DOME RAISED ABOVE THE CRATER EDGE WAS DISCOVERED NEAR THE CRATER COPERNICUS. THE DOME IS UNUSUAL AS IT IS GLOWING WHITE AND BLUE FROM INSIDE. A RATHER UNUSUAL OBJECT, WHICH IS UNUSUAL INDEED EVEN FOR THE MOON, WAS DISCOVERED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE FACTORY AREA. A DISK OF ABOUT 50 METERS IN DIAMETER STANDS ON A SQUARE BASEMENT SURROUNDED WITH RHOMBI WALLS. IN THE PICTURE, CLOSE TO THE RHOMBI, WE CAN ALSO SEE A DARK ROUND EMBRASURE IN THE GROUND, WHICH RESEMBLES AN ENTRY IN AN UNDERGROUND CAPONIER. THERE IS A REGULAR RECTANGULAR AREA BETWEEN FACTORY AND THE CRATER COPERNICUS WHICH IS 300 METERS WIDE 400 METERS LONG.

APOLLO 10 ASTRONAUTS MADE A UNIQUE PICTURE (AS10-32-4822) OF A ONE-MILE LONG OBJECT CALLED CASTLE, WHICH IS HANGING AT THE HEIGHT OF 14 KILOMETERS AND CASTS A DISTINCT SHADOW ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. THE OBJECT SEEMS TO BE CONSISTING OF SEVERAL CYLINDRICAL UNITS AND A LARGE CONJUNCTIVE UNIT. INTERNAL POROUS STRUCTURE OF THE CASTLE IS CLEARLY SEEN IN ONE OF THE PICTURES, WHICH MAKES AN IMPRESSION THAT SOME PARTS OF THE OBJECT ARE TRANSPARENT.

 

AS IT TURNED OUT AT THE BRIEFING WHERE MANY NASA SCIENTISTS WERE PRESENT, WHEN RICHARD HOAGLAND HAD REQUESTED ORIGINALS OF THE CASTLE PICTURES FOR THE SECOND TIME, NO PICTURES WERE FOUND THERE AT ALL. THEY DISAPPEARED EVEN FROM THE LIST OF PICTURES MADE BY THE APOLLO 10 CREW. ONLY INTERMEDIATE PICTURES OF THE OBJECT WERE FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DON'T DEPICT THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE OBJECT. WHEN APOLLO-12 CREW LANDED ON THE LUNAR SURFACE, THEY SAW THAT THE LANDING WAS OBSERVED BY A HALF-TRANSPARENT PYRAMIDAL OBJECT.

 

IT WAS HANGING JUST SEVERAL METERS ABOVE THE LUNAR SURFACE AND SHIMMERED WITH ALL RAINBOW COLORS AGAINST THE BLACK SKY. IN 1969, WHEN THE FILM ABOUT ASTRONAUTS TRAVELING TO THE SEA OF STORMS WAS DEMONSTRATED (THE ASTRONAUTS SAW THE STRANGE OBJECTS ONCE AGAIN, WHICH WERE LATER CALLED “STRIPED GLASSES”), NASA FINALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT CONSEQUENCES SUCH KIND OF CONTROL COULD BRING.

 

ASTRONAUT MITCHELL ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT HIS FEELINGS AFTER A SUCCESSFUL RETURN THE FOLLOWING:

“MY NECK STILL ACHES AS I HAD TO CONSTANTLY TURN MY HEAD AROUND BECAUSE WE FELT WE WERE NOT ALONE THERE. WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT PRAY.”

JOHNSTON, WHO WORKED AT THE HOUSTON SPACE CENTER AND STUDIED PHOTOS AND VIDEO MATERIALS DONE DURING THE APOLLO PROGRAM, DISCUSSED THE ARTIFACTS WITH RICHARD HOAGLAND AND SAID, THE NASA LEADERSHIP WAS AWFULLY ANNOYED WITH THE GREAT NUMBER OF ANOMALOUS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, OBJECTS ON THE MOON. IT WAS EVEN SAID THAT PILOTED FLIGHTS TO THE MOON COULD BE BANNED IN THE PROGRAMS NETWORK. INVESTIGATORS ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN ANCIENT STRUCTURES RESEMBLING PARTIALLY DESTROYED CITIES.

 

THE ORBITAL SHOOTING REVEALS AN ASTONISHINGLY REGULAR GEOMETRY OF SQUARE AND RECTANGULAR CONSTRUCTIONS. THEY RESEMBLE OUR TERRESTRIAL CITIES SEEN FROM THE HEIGHT OF 5-8 KILOMETERS. A MISSION CONTROL SPECIALIST COMMENTED ON THE PICTURES: “OUR GUYS OBSERVED RUINS OF THE LUNAR CITIES, TRANSPARENT PYRAMIDS, DOMES AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY HIDDEN DEEP INSIDE THE NASA SAFES, AND FELT LIKE ROBINSON CRUSOE WHEN HE SUDDENLY CAME ACROSS PRINTS OF HUMAN BARE FEET ON THE SAND OF THE DESERT ISLAND.” WHAT DO GEOLOGISTS AND SCIENTISTS SAY AFTER STUDYING THE PICTURES OF LUNAR CITIES AND OTHER ANOMALOUS OBJECTS?

 

THEY SAY, SUCH OBJECTS CAN'T BE NATURAL FORMATIONS. “WE SHOULD ADMIT THEY ARE ARTIFICIAL, ESPECIALLY THE DOMES AND PYRAMIDS.” REASONABLE ACTIVITY OF AN ALIEN CIVILIZATION SHOWED UP UNEXPECTEDLY CLOSE TO US. WE WERE NOT READY FOR IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY, AND SOME PEOPLE HARDLY BELIEVE THEY ARE TRUE EVEN NOW."

60 "... SYNTHESIZED FROM GYPSUM..."

"GYPSUM IS A COMMON MINERAL, WITH THICK AND EXTENSIVE EVAPORITE BEDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. DEPOSITS ARE KNOWN TO OCCUR IN STRATA FROM AS EARLY AS THE PERMIAN AGE. GYPSUM IS DEPOSITED IN LAKE AND SEA WATER, AS WELL AS IN HOT SPRINGS, FROM VOLCANIC VAPORS, AND SULFATE SOLUTIONS IN VEINS. HYDROTHERMAL ANHYDRITE IN VEINS IS COMMONLY HYDRATED TO GYPSUM BY GROUNDWATER IN NEAR SURFACE EXPOSURES. IT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE MINERALS HALITE AND SULFUR.


THE WORD GYPSUM IS DERIVED FROM THE AORIST FORM OF THE GREEK VERB JAYEIPEUIO, 'TO COOK", REFERRING TO THE BURNT OR CALCINED MINERAL. BECAUSE THE GYPSUM FROM THE QUARRIES OF THE MONTMARTRE DISTRICT OF PARIS HAS LONG FURNISHED BURNT GYPSUM USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, THIS MATERIAL HAS BEEN CALLED PLASTER OF PARIS. IT IS ALSO USED IN FOOT CREAMS, SHAMPOOS AND MANY OTHER HAIR PRODUCTS.


BECAUSE GYPSUM DISSOLVES OVER TIME IN WATER, GYPSUM IS RARELY FOUND IN THE FORM OF SAND. HOWEVER, THE UNIQUE CONDITIONS OF THE WHITE SANDS NATIONAL MONUMENT IN THE US STATE OF NEW MEXICO HAVE CREATED A 710 KM2 (275 SQ MILE) EXPANSE OF WHITE GYPSUM SAND, ENOUGH TO SUPPLY THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WITH DRYWALL FOR 1,000 YEARS."
