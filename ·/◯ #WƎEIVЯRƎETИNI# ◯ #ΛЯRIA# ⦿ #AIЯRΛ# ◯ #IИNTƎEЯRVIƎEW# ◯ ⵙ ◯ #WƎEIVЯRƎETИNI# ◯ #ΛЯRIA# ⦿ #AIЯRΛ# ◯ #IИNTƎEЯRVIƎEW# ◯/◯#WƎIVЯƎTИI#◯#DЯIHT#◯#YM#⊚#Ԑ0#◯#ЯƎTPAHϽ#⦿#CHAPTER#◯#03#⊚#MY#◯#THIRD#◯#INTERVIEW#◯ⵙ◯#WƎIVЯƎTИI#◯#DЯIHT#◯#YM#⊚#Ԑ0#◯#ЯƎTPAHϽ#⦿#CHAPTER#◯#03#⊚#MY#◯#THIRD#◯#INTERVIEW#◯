CHAPTER THREE - MY THIRD INTERVIEW

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"THE THIRD INTERVIEW, AND ALL SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS THAT I HAD WITH THE ALIEN WERE OBSERVED AND RECORDED, AS I MENTIONED ABOVE, BY DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT, A SPECIAL ROOM HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A WINDOW OF ONE-WAY GLASS THROUGH WHICH THE INTERVIEW COULD BE OBSERVED FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM, WITHOUT INTRUDING ON THE ALIEN.


THE ALIEN HAD BEEN MOVED INTO THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED ROOM AND WAS SEATED IN AN ORDINARY OVERSTUFFED LIVING ROOM CHAIR COVERED WITH A FLOWERY FABRIC. I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN SENT INTO TOWN TO BUY A CHAIR FROM THE NEAREST AVAILABLE FURNITURE STORE. THE ALIENS BODY WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS A VERY THIN 5 YEAR OLD CHILD, SO SHE WAS DWARFED BY THE CHAIR.


SINCE HER BODY WAS NOT BIOLOGICAL IT DIDN'T NEED ANY FOOD, AIR OR HEAT, AND APPARENTLY, SHE DIDN'T SLEEP EITHER. THERE WERE NO EYELIDS, OR EYEBROWS ABOVE HER EYES, SO THE EYES DIDN'T CLOSE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD TELL WHETHER SHE WAS SLEEPING OR AWAKE AS LONG AS SHE WAS SITTING UPRIGHT IN THE CHAIR. UNLESS SHE MOVED HER BODY OR GESTURED WITH HER HAND, IT WOULD BE HARD TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS EVEN ALIVE OR NOT, UNLESS YOU COULD PERCEIVE HER THOUGHTS.


EVENTUALLY, I LEARNED THAT THE ALIEN WAS NOT IDENTIFIED BY HER BODY, BUT BY HER "PERSONALITY", SO TO SPEAK. SHE WAS KNOWN BY HER FELLOW ALIENS AS "AIRL". THIS IS THE CLOSEST WORD I CAN USE TO DESCRIBE THE NAME USING THE ENGLISH ALPHABET. I SENSED THAT SHE PREFERRED THE FEMININE GENDER. I THINK WE SHARED A NATURAL, FEMALE EMPATHY AND NURTURING ATTITUDE TOWARD LIFE AND EACH OTHER. I AM SURE SHE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMBATIVE, AGGRESSIVE, DOMINEERING ATTITUDE OF THE MALE OFFICERS AND AGENTS, EACH OF WHOM WAS MORE CONCERNED WITH THEIR OWN PERSONAL SELF-IMPORTANCE AND POWER THAN WITH DISCOVERING THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE!


WHEN I ENTERED THE ROOM, SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE ME. I FELT A VERY GENUINE SENSE OF RECOGNITION, RELIEF AND A "WARM" FEELING FROM HER. IT WAS LIKE THE EAGER EXCITEMENT AND UNCONDITIONAL, PLATONIC AFFECTION ONE FEELS FROM A DOG OR CHILD, YET WITH A CALM AND RESERVED CONTROL. I MUST SAY THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT I FELT THE SAME SORT OF AFFECTION FOR THE ALIEN BEING, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAD SPENT SO


LITTLE TIME WITH EACH OTHER. I WAS PLEASED THAT I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE MY INTERVIEWS WITH HER IN SPITE OF ALL THE ATTENTION IT WAS GETTING FROM THE STREAM OF GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY PEOPLE ARRIVING AT THE BASE.


IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE NEXT SERIES OF QUESTIONS FOR ME WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN THEMSELVES, WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ME.


HERE ARE THE ANSWERS TO THE NEW LIST OF QUESTIONS:"

 

(OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW)
TOP SECRET
OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT OF THE U.S. ARMY AIR FORCE ROSWELL ARMY AIR FIELD, 50 9TH BOMB GROUP

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 11. 7. 1947

 

"QUESTION - CAN YOU READ OR WRITE ANY EARTH LANGUAGES?
ANSWER -NO.
QUESTION - DO YOU UNDERSTAND NUMBERS OR MATHEMATICS?
ANSWER -
YES. I AM OFFICER / PILOT / ENGINEER
QUESTION - CAN YOU WRITE OR DRAW SYMBOLS OR PICTURES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE INTO OUR OWN LANGUAGE?
ANSWER -UNCERTAIN
QUESTION - ARE THERE ANY OTHER SIGNS OR MEANS OF COMMUNICATION YOU CAN USE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND YOUR THOUGHTS MORE CLEARLY?
ANSWER -NO."
(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)


"I WAS VERY SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT TRUE. BUT, I UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY THAT AIRL WAS NOT WILLING TO COMMUNICATE IN WRITING OR DRAWING OR SIGN LANGUAGE. MY FEELING WAS THAT SHE WAS FOLLOWING ORDERS, LIKE ANY SOLDIER WHO HAS BEEN CAPTURED, NOT TO REVEAL ANY INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO AN ENEMY, EVEN UNDER TORTURE. SHE WAS ONLY ABLE AND WILLING TO REVEAL NON-CONFIDENTIAL, OR PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR "NAME, RANK AND SERIAL NUMBER"

SUBJECT: ALIEN INTERVIEW, 11. 7. 1947, 2ND SESSION


"QUESTION - CAN YOU SHOW US ON A MAP OF THE STARS WHICH IS THE STAR OF YOUR HOME PLANET? 36 (FOOTNOTE)
ANSWER -NO.


THIS IS NOT BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT KNOW THE DIRECTIONS FROM EARTH TO HER HOME PLANET. SHE WAS UNWILLING TO REVEAL THE LOCATION. IT WAS ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE STAR SYSTEM OF HER HOME PLANET DOES NOT EXIST ON ANY STAR MAP ON EARTH. IT IS TOO FAR AWAY.


QUESTION - HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOUR PEOPLE TO LOCATE YOU HERE?
ANSWER -UNKNOWN.
QUESTION - HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOUR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL HERE TO RESCUE YOU?
ANSWER -
MINUTES OR HOURS.
QUESTION - HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO NOT INTEND TO HARM YOU?
ANSWER -
INTENTIONS ARE CLEAR. SEE IN YOUR MIND / IMAGES /
FEELINGS.
QUESTION - IF YOU ARE NOT A BIOLOGICAL ENTITY, WHY DO YOU REFER TO YOURSELF AS FEMININE?
ANSWER -
I AM A CREATOR. MOTHER. SOURCE."

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"THESE QUESTIONS TOOK ME ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO COMPLETE. I REALIZED THEN THAT WE MAY BE IN FOR SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE IF THE ALIEN WAS NOT WILLING TO COOPERATE, OR REVEAL ANY INFORMATION THAT THE MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES OR SCIENTISTS CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL TO THEM.


I WAS ALSO SURE THAT THE ALIEN WAS VERY CERTAIN OF THE ACTUAL INTENTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THESE QUESTIONS, AS SHE COULD "READ THEIR MINDS" JUST AS EASILY AS SHE COULD READ MY THOUGHTS AND COMMUNICATE WITH ME TELEPATHICALLY. BECAUSE OF THESE INTENTIONS, SHE WAS UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO COOPERATE WITH ANY OF THEM IN ANY WAY, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

 

I AM EQUALLY SURE THAT SINCE SHE WAS NOT A BIOLOGICAL LIFE FORM, THAT THERE WAS NO KIND OF TORTURE OR COERCION THAT WOULD CHANGE HER MIND!"

 

 

FOOTNOTES

36 "...SHOW US ON A MAP OF THE STARS WHICH IS THE STAR OF YOUR HOME PLANET..."
"THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE THAN 100 BILLION (1011) GALAXIES IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE. MOST GALAXIES ARE 1,000 TO 100,000PARSECS (APPROXIMATELY 3.086*1016 M, 3.262 LIGHT-YEARS OR 19,176,075,967,324.937 MILES) IN DIAMETER AND ARE USUALLY SEPARATED BY DISTANCES ON THE ORDER OF MILLIONS OF PARSECS (OR MEGAPARSECS). INTERGALACTIC SPACE (THE SPACE BETWEEN GALAXIES) IS FILLED WITH A TENUOUS GAS OF AN AVERAGE DENSITY LESS THAN ONE ATOM PER CUBIC METER.


BEGINNING IN THE 1990S, THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE YIELDED IMPROVED OBSERVATIONS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT ESTABLISHED THAT THE MISSING DARK MATTER IN OUR GALAXY CANNOT SOLELY CONSIST OF INHERENTLY FAINT AND SMALL STARS. THE HUBBLE DEEP FIELD, AN EXTREMELY LONG EXPOSURE OF A RELATIVELY EMPTY PART OF THE SKY, PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE (AT LEAST) 125 BILLION GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE."

CHAPTER THREE - MY THIRD INTERVIEW

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"THE THIRD INTERVIEW, AND ALL SUBSEQUENT INTERVIEWS THAT I HAD WITH THE ALIEN WERE OBSERVED AND RECORDED, AS I MENTIONED ABOVE, BY DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT, A SPECIAL ROOM HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A WINDOW OF ONE-WAY GLASS THROUGH WHICH THE INTERVIEW COULD BE OBSERVED FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM, WITHOUT INTRUDING ON THE ALIEN.


THE ALIEN HAD BEEN MOVED INTO THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED ROOM AND WAS SEATED IN AN ORDINARY OVERSTUFFED LIVING ROOM CHAIR COVERED WITH A FLOWERY FABRIC. I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN SENT INTO TOWN TO BUY A CHAIR FROM THE NEAREST AVAILABLE FURNITURE STORE. THE ALIENS BODY WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS A VERY THIN 5 YEAR OLD CHILD, SO SHE WAS DWARFED BY THE CHAIR.


SINCE HER BODY WAS NOT BIOLOGICAL IT DIDN'T NEED ANY FOOD, AIR OR HEAT, AND APPARENTLY, SHE DIDN'T SLEEP EITHER. THERE WERE NO EYELIDS, OR EYEBROWS ABOVE HER EYES, SO THE EYES DIDN'T CLOSE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD TELL WHETHER SHE WAS SLEEPING OR AWAKE AS LONG AS SHE WAS SITTING UPRIGHT IN THE CHAIR. UNLESS SHE MOVED HER BODY OR GESTURED WITH HER HAND, IT WOULD BE HARD TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS EVEN ALIVE OR NOT, UNLESS YOU COULD PERCEIVE HER THOUGHTS.


EVENTUALLY, I LEARNED THAT THE ALIEN WAS NOT IDENTIFIED BY HER BODY, BUT BY HER "PERSONALITY", SO TO SPEAK. SHE WAS KNOWN BY HER FELLOW ALIENS AS "AIRL". THIS IS THE CLOSEST WORD I CAN USE TO DESCRIBE THE NAME USING THE ENGLISH ALPHABET. I SENSED THAT SHE PREFERRED THE FEMININE GENDER. I THINK WE SHARED A NATURAL, FEMALE EMPATHY AND NURTURING ATTITUDE TOWARD LIFE AND EACH OTHER. I AM SURE SHE DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMBATIVE, AGGRESSIVE, DOMINEERING ATTITUDE OF THE MALE OFFICERS AND AGENTS, EACH OF WHOM WAS MORE CONCERNED WITH THEIR OWN PERSONAL SELF-IMPORTANCE AND POWER THAN WITH DISCOVERING THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE!


WHEN I ENTERED THE ROOM, SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE ME. I FELT A VERY GENUINE SENSE OF RECOGNITION, RELIEF AND A "WARM" FEELING FROM HER. IT WAS LIKE THE EAGER EXCITEMENT AND UNCONDITIONAL, PLATONIC AFFECTION ONE FEELS FROM A DOG OR CHILD, YET WITH A CALM AND RESERVED CONTROL. I MUST SAY THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT I FELT THE SAME SORT OF AFFECTION FOR THE ALIEN BEING, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAD SPENT SO


LITTLE TIME WITH EACH OTHER. I WAS PLEASED THAT I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE MY INTERVIEWS WITH HER IN SPITE OF ALL THE ATTENTION IT WAS GETTING FROM THE STREAM OF GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY PEOPLE ARRIVING AT THE BASE.


IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE NEXT SERIES OF QUESTIONS FOR ME WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ALIEN THEMSELVES, WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ME.


HERE ARE THE ANSWERS TO THE NEW LIST OF QUESTIONS:"

"QUESTION - CAN YOU READ OR WRITE ANY EARTH LANGUAGES?
ANSWER -NO.
QUESTION - DO YOU UNDERSTAND NUMBERS OR MATHEMATICS?
ANSWER -
YES. I AM OFFICER / PILOT / ENGINEER
QUESTION - CAN YOU WRITE OR DRAW SYMBOLS OR PICTURES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE INTO OUR OWN LANGUAGE?
ANSWER -UNCERTAIN
QUESTION - ARE THERE ANY OTHER SIGNS OR MEANS OF COMMUNICATION YOU CAN USE TO HELP US UNDERSTAND YOUR THOUGHTS MORE CLEARLY?
ANSWER -NO."
(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)


"I WAS VERY SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT TRUE. BUT, I UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY THAT AIRL WAS NOT WILLING TO COMMUNICATE IN WRITING OR DRAWING OR SIGN LANGUAGE. MY FEELING WAS THAT SHE WAS FOLLOWING ORDERS, LIKE ANY SOLDIER WHO HAS BEEN CAPTURED, NOT TO REVEAL ANY INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO AN ENEMY, EVEN UNDER TORTURE. SHE WAS ONLY ABLE AND WILLING TO REVEAL NON-CONFIDENTIAL, OR PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR "NAME, RANK AND SERIAL NUMBER"

"QUESTION - CAN YOU SHOW US ON A MAP OF THE STARS WHICH IS THE STAR OF YOUR HOME PLANET? 36 (FOOTNOTE)
ANSWER -NO.


THIS IS NOT BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT KNOW THE DIRECTIONS FROM EARTH TO HER HOME PLANET. SHE WAS UNWILLING TO REVEAL THE LOCATION. IT WAS ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE STAR SYSTEM OF HER HOME PLANET DOES NOT EXIST ON ANY STAR MAP ON EARTH. IT IS TOO FAR AWAY.


QUESTION - HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOUR PEOPLE TO LOCATE YOU HERE?
ANSWER -UNKNOWN.
QUESTION - HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE YOUR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL HERE TO RESCUE YOU?
ANSWER -
MINUTES OR HOURS.
QUESTION - HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO NOT INTEND TO HARM YOU?
ANSWER -
INTENTIONS ARE CLEAR. SEE IN YOUR MIND / IMAGES /
FEELINGS.
QUESTION - IF YOU ARE NOT A BIOLOGICAL ENTITY, WHY DO YOU REFER TO YOURSELF AS FEMININE?
ANSWER -
I AM A CREATOR. MOTHER. SOURCE."

 

(MATILDA O'DONNELL MACELROY PERSONAL NOTE)
"THESE QUESTIONS TOOK ME ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO COMPLETE. I REALIZED THEN THAT WE MAY BE IN FOR SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE IF THE ALIEN WAS NOT WILLING TO COOPERATE, OR REVEAL ANY INFORMATION THAT THE MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES OR SCIENTISTS CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL TO THEM.


I WAS ALSO SURE THAT THE ALIEN WAS VERY CERTAIN OF THE ACTUAL INTENTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THESE QUESTIONS, AS SHE COULD "READ THEIR MINDS" JUST AS EASILY AS SHE COULD READ MY THOUGHTS AND COMMUNICATE WITH ME TELEPATHICALLY. BECAUSE OF THESE INTENTIONS, SHE WAS UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO COOPERATE WITH ANY OF THEM IN ANY WAY, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

 

I AM EQUALLY SURE THAT SINCE SHE WAS NOT A BIOLOGICAL LIFE FORM, THAT THERE WAS NO KIND OF TORTURE OR COERCION THAT WOULD CHANGE HER MIND!"

 

 

FOOTNOTES

36 "...SHOW US ON A MAP OF THE STARS WHICH IS THE STAR OF YOUR HOME PLANET..."
"THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE THAN 100 BILLION (1011) GALAXIES IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE. MOST GALAXIES ARE 1,000 TO 100,000PARSECS (APPROXIMATELY 3.086*1016 M, 3.262 LIGHT-YEARS OR 19,176,075,967,324.937 MILES) IN DIAMETER AND ARE USUALLY SEPARATED BY DISTANCES ON THE ORDER OF MILLIONS OF PARSECS (OR MEGAPARSECS). INTERGALACTIC SPACE (THE SPACE BETWEEN GALAXIES) IS FILLED WITH A TENUOUS GAS OF AN AVERAGE DENSITY LESS THAN ONE ATOM PER CUBIC METER.


BEGINNING IN THE 1990S, THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE YIELDED IMPROVED OBSERVATIONS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT ESTABLISHED THAT THE MISSING DARK MATTER IN OUR GALAXY CANNOT SOLELY CONSIST OF INHERENTLY FAINT AND SMALL STARS. THE HUBBLE DEEP FIELD, AN EXTREMELY LONG EXPOSURE OF A RELATIVELY EMPTY PART OF THE SKY, PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE (AT LEAST) 125 BILLION GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE."
